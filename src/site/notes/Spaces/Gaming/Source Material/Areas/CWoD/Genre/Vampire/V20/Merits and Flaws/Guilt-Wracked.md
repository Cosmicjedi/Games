# Guilt-Wracked
You simply cannot come to grips with the fact that
you must drink blood to survive. You suffer horrible
guilt over each time you feed (roll Conscience, difficulty
7, or else frenzy every time you feed — characters
with the Conviction Virtue cannot take this Flaw) and
try to avoid doing so as much as possible. This means
that you rarely have much blood in your system, leaving
you vulnerable to both attacks and hunger-based
frenzies.
