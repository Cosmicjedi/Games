# Grip of the Damned
There is no ecstasy in your Embrace — only terror
and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle and
shriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you to
grapple with them for as long as you wish to take their
blood. For vampires with high Humanity, this experience
may require a Humanity roll, at the discretion of
the Storyteller. Giovanni cannot take this Flaw.
