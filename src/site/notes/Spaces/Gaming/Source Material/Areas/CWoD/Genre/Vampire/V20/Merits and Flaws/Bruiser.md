# Bruiser
Your appearance is sufficiently thug-like to inspire
fear (or at least disquiet) in those who see you. While
you’re not necessarily ugly, you do radiate a quiet menace,
to the point where people cross the street to avoid
passing near you. All Intimidation rolls against those
who have not demonstrated their physical superiority
to you are at -1 difficulty.
