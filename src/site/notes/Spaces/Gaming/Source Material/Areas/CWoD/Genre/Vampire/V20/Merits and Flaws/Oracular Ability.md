# Oracular Ability
You can see and interpret signs and omens. You are
able to draw advice from these omens, for they provide
hints of the future and warnings of the present.
When the Storyteller feels that you are in position to
see an omen, you will be required to make a Perception
+ Awareness roll, with the difficulty relative to how
well the omen is concealed. If successful, you may then
roll Intelligence + Occult to interpret what you have
seen; the difficulty is again relative to the complexity
of the omen.
