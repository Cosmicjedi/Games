# Broken Bond
You were once blood-bound but have secretly slipped
the leash, and you are free to act as you will once more.
Your regnant has no idea that you are not in fact bound,
and continues to treat you as if you were. At Storyteller
discretion, the experience of having been bound once
may render you immune to ever being enthralled again.
Sabbat vampires cannot take this Merit.
