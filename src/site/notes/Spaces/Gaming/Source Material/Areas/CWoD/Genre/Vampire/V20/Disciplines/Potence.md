# Potence
Kindred endowed with Potence possess unnatural
strength. This Discipline enables vampire to leap
massive distances, lift tremendous weights, and strike
opponents with brutal force. Even low ranks of this
power can give Kindred physical power beyond mortal
bounds. More powerful Kindred can leap so far that
they appear to be flying, toss cars like soda cans, and
punch through walls like cardboard. While the more
subtle mental Disciplines can be awe-inspiring, the
brutal effectiveness of Potence is formidable in its own
right.
The Brujah, Giovanni, Lasombra, and Nosferatu are
naturally gifted with this Discipline, but members of
other Clans often make a point to find someone who
can teach them the awesome power of Potence.
System: Each dot that the vampire has in Potence
adds one die to all Strength-related dice rolls. Further,
the player can spend one blood point and change his
Potence dice into an equal number of automatic successes
to all Strength-related rolls for the turn. In melee
and brawling combat, successes from Potence (either
rolled or automatic) are applied to the damage roll
results.
Potence 6+
While flesh and blood have their limits, undead sinews
and vitae have a bit more latitude when it comes
to feats of strength. Vampires who are close to Caine in
descent are sometimes capable of strength-based maneuvers
that awe even other vampires. A product of
blood and will as much as of muscle and bone, mastery
of Potence gives a vampire the ability to do far more
than just lift progressively heavier objects — if the
vampire himself is willing to learn an alternate way.
Advanced Potence powers can be purchased in the
same fashion as advanced Celerity or Fortitude powers:
A character can choose to learn an alternate power instead
of advancing along the Discipline’s normal progression,
and can later go back and re-purchase what
he’s missed.

## ••••• • Crush
The vampire with this refined application of Potence
knows just how to apply her deadly strength to destroying
inanimate objects.
System: Spend two blood points to activate Crush for
the scene. With a successful attack against an object, your
character automatically destroys it. In the case of weapons
or armor on active combatants, this may mean a targeted
attack. If you choose to destroy a victim’s weapons or armor,
they take no damage from the attack.

## ••••• • Imprint
A vampire with extensive knowledge of Potence can
squeeze very, very hard. As a matter of fact, she can
squeeze (or press, or push) so hard that she can leave
an imprint of her fingers or hand in any hard surface
up to and including solid steel. A use of Imprint can
VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION 193
simply serve as a threat, or it can be used, for example,
to dig handholds into sheer surfaces for purposes of
climbing.
System: Imprint requires a point of blood to activate.
The power remains active for the duration of a scene.
The depth of the imprint the vampire creates with Imprint
is up to the Storyteller — decisions should take
into account how much force the vampire can bring to
bear, the toughness of the material, and its thickness.
If the object the vampire grasps is thin enough, at the
Storyteller’s discretion, the vampire might simply be
able to push through it (in the case of a wall) or tear it
off (in the case of a spear or pipe).

## Relentless Pursuit (Potence ••••• •)
This power is an improvement on Leaps and Bounds
(p. 49).
System: There is no cost to use this power, which is
always active. The Brujah doubles the number of automatic
successes granted by Potence when applying them to jump
rolls. A Dexterity + Athletics roll is required to make sure
the character lands safely.

## ••••• •• Brutality
With this level of power, the Cainite’s hands move
through flesh the way a mortal’s moves through packed
sand.
System: A character with Brutality causes lethal
damage with her unarmed strikes. Her unarmed strikes
may only be dodged, not blocked or parried, as her punches
move weapons and shields aside effortlessly. This power
does not require activation, and is considered “always on”
unless the user wills it.

## ••••• •• Earthshock
According to some pundits, Potence is merely the
art of hitting something very hard. But what do you
do when your target is too far away to hit directly? The
answer is, if you’re sufficiently talented with the Discipline,
to employ Earthshock. On its simplest level,
Earthshock is the ability to hit the ground at point A,
and subsequently have the force of the blow emerge
from the ground at point B.
System: The use of Earthshock requires the expenditure
of two blood points, as well as a normal Dexterity
+ Brawl roll. The vampire punches or stamps on the
ground, and, if the attack is a success, the force of the
blow emerges from the ground as a geyser of stone and
earth directly underneath the target. The attack can be
dodged at a +2 difficulty.
Earthshock’s range is 10 feet or three meters for every
level of Potence the vampire has, up to the limits
of visibility. A failure on the attack roll means that
the strike goes errant and is liable to explode anywhere
within range; a botch means that the vampire pulverizes
the ground beneath him and may well bury himself
in the process.

## ••••• ••• Aftershock
The eldest practitioners of Potence can infuse the
power of their blood to delay the physical devastation of
her attacks. Instead of destroying an opponent immediately,
she stores her Potence in their body for later effect.
System: Make an attack normally. Spend three blood
points and do not add Potence to the damage pool. If the
attack causes the victim one point of damage after soak,
Aftershock takes effect. Instead of adding Potence as dice
or automatic successes to the damage pool, Aftershock
“stores” those automatic damage levels for later. Specify
any time in the next 24 hours. At that time, the victim
suffers lethal damage equal to your character’s Potence
to the victim. A character may only have one instance
of Aftershock “storing” damage at a time.

## ••••• ••• Flick
It is a truism that “the great ones always make it look
easy.” In the case of Flick, that saying stops being a
truism and becomes literal truth. With this power, a
master of Potence can make the slightest gesture — a
wave, a snap of the fingers, the toss of a ball — and
have it unleash the full, devastating impact of a deadon
strike. The attack can come without warning, limiting
the target’s ability to dodge or anticipate; this makes
Flick one of the most feared applications of Potence.
System: Flick costs a point of blood, and requires
a Dexterity + Brawl roll (difficulty 6). The vampire
must also make some sort of gesture directing the blow.
What the gesture is remains up to the player — anything
from a snap of the fingers to a blown kiss has
worked in the past.
Flick‘s range is equal to the limit of the Kindred’s
perception, and the blow struck does damage equal to
a normal punch (including all bonuses).
