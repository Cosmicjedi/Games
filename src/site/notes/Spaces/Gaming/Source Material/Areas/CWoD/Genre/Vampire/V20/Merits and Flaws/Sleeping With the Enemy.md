# Sleeping With the Enemy
You have some sort of intimate connection with a
member of an opposing Sect or inimical Clan. You may
have a lover, a childe, a friend, or a contact working
the other side of the fence, but regardless of politics
you retain a friendly (or more than friendly) relationship
with your putative foe. Your close ties to someone
on the other side would be regarded as treason by your
superiors within the Sect, and if you are discovered,
the penalty will surely be death.
