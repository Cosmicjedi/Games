# Prestigious Sire
Your sire has or had great status in her Sect or Clan,
and this has accorded you a certain amount of prestige.
Though your sire may no longer have any dealings
with you, the simple fact of your ancestry has marked
you forever. This prestige might aid you greatly in dealings
with other vampires, or it might engender jealousy
or contempt.
