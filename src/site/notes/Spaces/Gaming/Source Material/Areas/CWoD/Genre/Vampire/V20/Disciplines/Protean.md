# Protean
Protean allows the Kindred the mystical ability to
manipulate his physical form. Some vampires believe
the power stems from a heightened connection to the
natural world, while others consider it to be a magnification
of the mark of Caine. Whatever its basis may
be, those that develop this Discipline can grow bestial
claws, take on the forms of bats and wolves, turn themselves
into mist, and even meld into the very earth itself.
Transformed Kindred can generally use other Disciplines
— vampires in wolf form can still read auras and
communicate with other animals, for example. However,
the Storyteller may rule that certain Disciplines
may not be used in specific situations. The Kindred’s
clothes and personal possessions also change when he
transforms (presumably absorbed within his very substance),
although armor and the like do not provide
any benefit while transformed.
Vampires cannot change or transform large objects or
other beings; Protean is a personal expression of power.
A Kindred who has been staked (thereby trapping his
soul within his body) cannot transform. Some vampires
believe that those who have mastered the highest
levels of Protean can deny this limitation, however.
The Gangrel Clan is well known for their mastery of
Protean, although other Kindred have learned some of
this Discipline’s secrets from these bestial Cainites.
## • Eyes of the Beast
The vampire sees perfectly well in pitch darkness,
not requiring a light source to notice details in even
the darkest basement or cave. The vampire’s Beast is
evident in his red glowing eyes, a sight sure to disturb
most mortals.
System: The character must declare his desire to call
forth the Eyes. No roll is necessary, but the change requires
a full turn to complete. While manifesting the
Eyes, the character suffers a +1 difficulty to all Social
rolls with mortals unless he takes steps to shield his
eyes (sunglasses are the simplest solution). (A vampire
without this power who is immersed in total darkness
suffers blind-fighting penalties as per p. 274.)
•• Feral Claws
The vampire’s nails transform into long, bestial claws.
These talons are wickedly sharp, able to rend flesh with
ease and even carve stone and metal with little trouble.
The Beast is prominent in the claws as well, making
them fearsome weapons against other immortals. It’s
rumored that some Gangrel have modified this power
to change their vampiric fangs into vicious tusks.
System: The claws grow automatically in response to
the character’s desire, and can grow from both hands
and feet. The transformation requires the expenditure
of a blood point, takes a single turn to complete, and
lasts for a scene.
The character attacks normally in combat, but the
claws inflict Strength + 1 aggravated damage. Other
supernaturals cannot normally soak this damage, although
a power such as Fortitude may be used. Additionally,
the difficulties of all climbing rolls are reduced
by two.
••• Earth Meld
One of the most prized powers within Protean,
Earth Meld enables the vampire to become one with
the earth. The immortal literally sinks into the bare
ground, transmuting his substance to bond with the
earth.
Though a vampire can immerse himself fully into the
ground, he cannot move around within it. Further, it
is impossible to meld into earth through another substance.
Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocks
Earth Meld’s effectiveness — then again, it’s a relatively
simple matter for a vampire at this level of power
to grow claws and rip apart enough of the flooring to
expose the raw soil beneath.
By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gains
full protection from daylight when outdoors. It is also
the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to
sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves
in the earth’s embrace, gaining strength and
power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred
whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within the
ground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives.
While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional
state between flesh and earth. His physical presence
exists between the physical world and the astral plane.
As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through
supernatural means. However, a disruption to the soil
that the immortal occupies, or to his presence on the
astral realm, returns him immediately to the physical
world (and to full wakefulness), showering dirt outward
as his body displaces the soil.
System: No roll is necessary, although the character
must spend a blood point. Sinking into the earth is
