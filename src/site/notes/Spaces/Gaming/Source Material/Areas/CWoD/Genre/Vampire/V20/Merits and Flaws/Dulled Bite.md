# Dulled Bite
For some reason your fangs never developed fully,
or they may not have manifested at all. When feeding,
you need to find some other method of making
the blood flow. Failing that, you must achieve double
the normal number of successes in order to make your
bite penetrate properly. A number of Caitiff and high-
Generation vampires often manifest this Flaw.
