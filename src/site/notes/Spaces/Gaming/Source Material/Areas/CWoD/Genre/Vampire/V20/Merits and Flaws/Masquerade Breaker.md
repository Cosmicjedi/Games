# Masquerade Breaker
In your first nights as a vampire, you accidentally
broke the Masquerade — and were spotted doing so.
Someone else covered for your mistake, but holds the
favor over you. Now you exist in fear that your error
will be revealed. In the meantime, your “savior” takes
pitiless advantage of you. This Flaw can only be taken
by vampires in Sects or Clans that respect the Masquerade.
