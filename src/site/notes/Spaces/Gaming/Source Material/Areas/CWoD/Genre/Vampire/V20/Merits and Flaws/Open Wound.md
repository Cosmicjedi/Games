# Open Wound
You have one or more wounds that refuse to heal,
and which constantly drip blood. This slow leakage
costs you an extra blood point per evening (marked off
just before dawn), in addition to drawing attention to
you. If the wound is visible, you are at + 1 difficulty for
all Social-based rolls. For two points, the Flaw is simply
unsightly and has the basic effect mentioned above; for
four points the seeping wound is serious or disfiguring
and includes the effects of the Flaw Permanent Wound
(below).
