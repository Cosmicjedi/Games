# Laughingstock
Somehow you’ve drawn the scorn of the local Harpies,
who make you their favorite target. You are at
a +2 difficulty on all Social rolls in Elysium and a +1
anywhere else in the city. In addition, you are at +2
difficulty to use Intimidation or any Dominate powers
on anyone who has heard the stories mocking you.
This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires.
