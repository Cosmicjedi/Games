You’re part of the brute squad the local Sheriff or
Bishop calls on when he needs some muscle. As a
result, you get in on action that others miss entirely,
score points with those in power, and occasionally get
a chance to act outside of the law. How far outside
the law you can go depends on circumstance and how
much the vampire you report to likes you.
