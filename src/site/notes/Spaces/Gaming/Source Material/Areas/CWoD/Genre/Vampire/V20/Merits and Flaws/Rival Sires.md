# Rival Sires
The flip side of Escaped Target, two vampires wanted
to gift you with the Embrace. One succeeded, one
failed — and she’s not happy about that failure. You,
your actual sire, or both of you have become the target
of the failed suitor’s ire. Regardless, your persecutor is
at +2 difficulty to refrain from frenzy in your presence.
In addition, she may well be working actively to discredit
or destroy you.
