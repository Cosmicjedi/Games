# Permanent Fangs
Your fangs do not retract, making it impossible for
you to hide your true nature. While some mortals may
think you’ve had your teeth filed or are wearing prosthetics,
sooner or later you’re going to run into someone
who knows what you truly are. You are also limited
to a maximum Appearance rating of 3.
