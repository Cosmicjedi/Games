# Glowing Eyes
You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampire
legend, which gives you a -1 difficulty on Intimidation
rolls when you’re dealing with mortals. However, the
tradeoffs are many; you must constantly disguise your
condition (no, contacts don’t cut it); the glow impairs
your vision and puts you at +1 difficulty on all sightbased
rolls (including the use of ranged weapons); and
the radiance emanating from your eye sockets makes
it difficult to hide (+2 difficulty to Stealth rolls) in the
dark.
