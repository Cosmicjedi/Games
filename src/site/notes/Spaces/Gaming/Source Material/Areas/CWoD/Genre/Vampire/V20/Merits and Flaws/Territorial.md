# Territorial
You are extremely territorial, staking out a particular
area as your hunting ground and reacting aggressively
to trespassers. If another vampire enters your territory
uninvited, you must make a frenzy roll. If you fail, you
immediately attack the interloper and continue attacking
until the intruder is dead or has left your hunting
grounds. You are reluctant to leave your territory
except in desperate circumstances.
Thirst for Innocence (2pt. Flaw)
The sight of innocence — of any sort — arouses in
you a terrible bloodlust. Roll Self-Control or Instincts,
or else frenzy and attack the source of your hunger.
