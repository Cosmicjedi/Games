# Zombie Statistics
Corpses animated by a necromancer of the
Bone Path have Strength 3, Dexterity 2,
Stamina 4, Brawl 2, and always act last in
a turn (unless there are mitigating circumstances).
They have zero Willpower points to
spend, but resist attacks as if they have Willpower
ratings of 10. All Mental and Social
ratings are zero for a reanimated corpse, and
zombies never attempt to dodge. Zombiesâ€™
dice pools are not affected by damage, except
that caused by fire or the claws and teeth of
supernatural creatures. Most zombies have
10 health levels, but they are incapable of
healing any damage they suffer. They have
no minds or personalities to affect, so they are
immune to uses of powers such as Dominate
and Presence. Unless otherwise noted, they
likewise cannot be usurped from the control
of the necromancer invoking them.
