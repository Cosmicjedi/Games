# Medium
You possess the natural affinity to sense and hear spirits,
ghosts, and shades. Though you cannot see them,
you can sense them, speak to them and, through pleading
or cajoling, draw them to your presence. You may
call upon them for aid or advice, but there will always
be a price. Also, your difficulty is reduced by two for all
Awareness rolls involving the spirits of the dead.
