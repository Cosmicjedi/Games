# Phobia
You have an overpowering fear of something. Spiders,
snakes, crowds, and heights are examples of common
phobias. You must make a Courage roll every time
you encounter the object of your fear. The difficulty of
the roll is determined by the Storyteller. If you fail the
roll, you must retreat from the object.
