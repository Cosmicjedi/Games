# Deathsight
Everything appears rotted and decayed to you. The
world appears to you as a corpse; mortals look diseased
or skeletal, buildings seem decrepit, and your fellow
Kindred seem to be walking, moldering cadavers. You
are at -2 difficulty to resist all rolls based on Appearance, but by the same token you are at +2 difficulty
on all Perception-based rolls. In addition, you find social
interaction difficult and are at +1 difficulty on all
Social-based rolls.
