# New Kid
You’re the latest in the city to be Embraced or have
yet to prove yourself to your Sect, and everyone knows
it. That automatically puts you at the bottom of the
social totem pole. Other neonates take every opportunity
to demonstrate your inferiority, or rival packs
constantly test your worthiness to the Sabbat. Even
if someone else is added to the ranks of the unliving,
you’re still regarded as something as a bit of a geek by
your peers — a distinction that can have dangerous
consequences if bullets start flying. All Social-related
rolls are at +1 difficulty when you are dealing with other
neonates. (Ancillae and elders lump you in with all
the other neonates under their general disdain.)
