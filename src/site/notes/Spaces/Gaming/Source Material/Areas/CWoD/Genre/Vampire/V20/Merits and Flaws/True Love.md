# True Love
You have discovered, perhaps too late, a true love.
He or she is mortal, but is the center of your existence,
and inspires you to keep going in a world of darkness
and despair. Whenever you suffer, the thought of your
true love gives you the strength to persevere. This Merit grants you one automatic success on all Willpower
rolls, which can be negated only by a botch die. This
can be a great gift but also a hindrance, for your true
love may require protection and occasionally rescue.
