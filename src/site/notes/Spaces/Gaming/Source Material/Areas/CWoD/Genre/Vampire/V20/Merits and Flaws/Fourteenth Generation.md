# Fourteenth Generation
You were created five or fewer years ago by a member
of the Thirteenth Generation. Though you have
10 blood points in your body, only eight of them may
be used to heal wounds, power Disciplines, raise Attributes,
etc. You can still use the final two blood points
for other purposes, though. The blood point costs of
nightly rising, creating and sustaining ghouls, and creating
blood bonds remains the same as for other vampires.
You cannot raise any Discipline above four dots.
Taking this Flaw precludes you from taking the Generation
Background, and you may not start with Status,
either. You are likely a Clanless Caitiff, for your blood
is probably too thin to pass down the distinguishing
characteristics of a Clan. Most Fourteenth-Generation
vampires should also take the Thin Blood Flaw
(p. 483).
