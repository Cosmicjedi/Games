# Infertile Vitae
During your Embrace, something went horribly
wrong, causing your blood to mutate under the stress
of dying and rising again. All those you try to Embrace
die. No matter what you do, you may not create any
childer. However, your blood can still be used in blood
rituals like Thaumaturgy and the Vaulderie, or for any
other vampiric needs like making ghouls.
