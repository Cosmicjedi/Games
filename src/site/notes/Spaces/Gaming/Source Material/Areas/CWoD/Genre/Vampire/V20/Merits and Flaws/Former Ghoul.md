# Former Ghoul
You were introduced to the Blood long before you
were made Kindred. Your long experience as a ghoul
gives you insight into and comfort with vampiric society.
You are at -1 difficulty on all Social rolls when in
the presence of other neonates (particularly those who
haven’t been educated by their sires), and have a -1
difficulty on all rolls relating to vampiric knowledge.
