# Boon (1-6pt. Merit)
Someone owes you a favor. The vampire in your debt
might be the lowliest neonate in the city or might be
the Prince herself; it all depends on how many points
the Merit costs. You only have that single favor owed
you (unless you take the Merit multiple times), so using
it properly is of paramount importance. Depending
on status and other factors, the vampire who owes you
a favor may well resent his debt, and might go out of
his way to “settle” it early — even going so far as to
create situations from which he must “rescue” you and
thus clear the slate.
