Someone in power doesn’t want you around. Maybe
she wants territory you possess, or is jealous of the attention
you’re getting from a prize mortal retainer —
the details are irrelevant. What does matter is that she
has the power to maneuver you into dangerous situations
“for the good of the Sect,” and has no compunctions
about doing so
