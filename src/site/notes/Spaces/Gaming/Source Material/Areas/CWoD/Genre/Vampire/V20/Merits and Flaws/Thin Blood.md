# Thin Blood
Your blood is thin, weak, and does not sustain you
well. All blood point costs are doubled (e.g., using
blood-related Disciplines or healing damage), although
you only lose one blood upon rising in the evening.
Furthermore, you are unable to create a blood bond,
and efforts to sire other vampires succeed only one in
five times.
