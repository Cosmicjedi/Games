# Amnesia
You are unable to remember anything about your
past, yourself, or your family (whether mortal or vampiric),
though your past might well come back to haunt
you. Your origins and the circumstances behind your
amnesia are for the Storyteller to determine, and she is
encouraged to make it as interesting as possible.
