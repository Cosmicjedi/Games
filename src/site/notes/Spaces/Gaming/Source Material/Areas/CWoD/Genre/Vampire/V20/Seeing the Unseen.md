# Seeing the Unseen
Auspex enables Kindred to perceive many things beyond the limits of lesser senses. Among its many uses, Auspex can detect the presence of a supernatural being who is hidden from normal sight (a vampire using Obfuscate, for example, or a ghost) or pierce illusions created by the Discipline of Chimerstry. Note: “Normal sight” includes regular, non-Auspex use of the Awareness skill. 

1) ***Obfuscate**: 
* When a vampire tries to use her heightened perceptions to notice a Kindred hidden with Obfuscate, she detects the subject’s presence if her Auspex rating is higher than his Obfuscate, and she succeeds at a **Perception + Awareness roll** (*difficulty equals 7 minus the number of dots by which her Auspex exceeds his Obfuscate*). 
* Conversely, if the target’s Obfuscate outranks her Auspex, he remains undiscovered. 
* If the two ratings are equal, both characters make a ***resisted roll*** of **Perception + Awareness** (Auspex user) against **Manipulation + Subterfuge** (Obfuscate user). *The difficulty for both rolls is 7*, and the character with the most successes wins. 

2) **Chimerstry**: 
* Likewise, vampires with Auspex may seek to penetrate illusions created with Chimerstry. The Auspex-wielder must actively seek to pierce the illusion (i.e., the player must tell the Storyteller that his character is trying to detect an illusion).
* The Auspex-user and Chimerstry-wielder then compare relative ratings, per Obfuscate, above. The process is otherwise identical to piercing Obfuscate.

3) **Other Powers**: 
   * Since the powers of beings like magi and wraiths function differently from vampiric Disciplines, a simple comparison of relative ratings isn’t applicable. To keep things simple, both characters make a resisted roll. The vampire rolls **Perception + Awareness**, while the subject rolls **Manipulation + Subterfuge**. Again, the *difficulty is 7*, and the character with the most successes wins.
