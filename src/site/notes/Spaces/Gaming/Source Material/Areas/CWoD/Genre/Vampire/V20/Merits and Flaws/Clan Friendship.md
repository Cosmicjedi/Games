# Clan Friendship
One particular Clan (not your own) has a special liking
for you. You might have done the Clan as a whole a
favor at some point, or perhaps you’re just a loud voice
in support of their aims. Whatever the case, you’re at
-2 difficulty on all friendly Social rolls involving members
of the Clan in question. Of course, the reaction
your cozy relationship with another Clan is likely to
draw from your own Clan leaders is an entirely different
can of worms.
