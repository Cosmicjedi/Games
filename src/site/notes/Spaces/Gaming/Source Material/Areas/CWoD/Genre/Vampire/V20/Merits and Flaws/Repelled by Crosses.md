# Repelled by Crosses
You are repelled by the sight of ordinary crosses,
believing them to be symbols of holy might. When
confronted by a cross, you must make a Willpower roll
(difficulty 9) or flee from the symbol for the duration
of the scene. If you botch the roll, not only must you
attempt to flee, but the touch of the cross can cause aggravated
damage (one health level of damage per turn
that the cross touches your skin). This damage cannot
be soaked, even if the vampire possesses Fortitude.
