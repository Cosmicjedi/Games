# Whither Mortis?
Lost Clans and bloodlines, such as the Cappadocians
and the Lamia, had access to an
ancient Discipline known as Mortis. Some
Kindred scholars claim that Mortis and Necromancy
are distinct Disciplines, but for ease
the three Mortis paths presented in this book
are listed as Necromancy paths. The Cappadocians
(see p. 418) specialized in either the
Corpse in the Monster or the Grave’s Decay,
while the Lamia (see p. 422) generally took
the Path of the Four Humors as their primary
path. Rumors are that the Harbingers of Skulls
(see p. 402) in the Sabbat have relearned the
Corpse in the Monster and the Grave’s Decay,
claiming them collectively as the “Mortuus
Path,” but they still tend to follow most modern
necromancers and choose Sepulchre Path
as their primary path before learning Grave’s
Decay or the Corpse in the Monster.
