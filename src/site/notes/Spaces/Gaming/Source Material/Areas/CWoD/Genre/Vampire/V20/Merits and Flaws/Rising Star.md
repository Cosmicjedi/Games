# Rising Star
You’re one of the up-and-comers in the city, a rising
star in your Sect. Everyone wants to know you and be
your friend, even as those in power groom you for positions
of greater responsibility. You are at -1 difficulty
on all Social rolls against any vampires in your Sect
who aren’t actively opposing your ascent.
