# Eat Food

You have the capacity to eat food and even savor its
taste. While you cannot derive any nourishment from
eating regular foods, this ability will serve you well in
pretending to be human. Of course, you can’t digest
what you eat, and there will be some point during the
evening when you have to heave it back up.
