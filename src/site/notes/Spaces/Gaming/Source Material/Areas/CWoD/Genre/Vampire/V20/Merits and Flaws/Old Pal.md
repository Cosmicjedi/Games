# Old Pal
An acquaintance from your breathing days was Embraced
at the same time you were. Fortunately, your
friendship has endured even death and unlife, and you
find a constant source of support and aid in your old
friend. She expects the same of you, which isn’t always
convenient, but at least you each have someone to
hang onto who remembers the good old nights — and
days. The Storyteller should play the Old Pal as a very
loyal Ally.
