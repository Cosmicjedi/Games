# Weak-Willed
You are highly susceptible to Dominate and intimidation
by others; Dominate attempts automatically affect
you unless the Discipline wielder is of higher Generation,
and your difficulties to resist Social abilities such
as Intimidation or Leadership, as well as mind-altering
spells or magic, are increased by two. Your Willpower
Trait may never rise above 4.
Conspicuous Consumption (4pt. Flaw)
It is not enough for you to draw nourishment from
the blood of mortals — you believe you must also consume
your victim’s heart, liver, and other blood-rich
tissue. Of course, this will necessitate the deaths of all
of your victims (unless you are extremely creative),
which might lead to numerous problems with maintaining
Humanity (and a low profile). Characters with
this Flaw should additionally purchase the Eat Food
Merit.
