# Stereotype
You buy heavily into all of the vampire stories you’ve
read and heard. You wear a cape or body glitter, speak
with an accent, and otherwise act in a cartoonish fashion.
Such behavior is embarrassing in the extreme to
other Kindred, who are likely to ostracize or mock you
(+2 difficulty to Social rolls with other vampires who
don’t share your habits). You also stand out to hunters.
