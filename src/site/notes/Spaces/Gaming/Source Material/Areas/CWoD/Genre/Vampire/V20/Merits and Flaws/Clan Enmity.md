# Clan Enmity
One Clan in particular wants you dead. You have offended
the entire Clan, from elders to neonates, and as a
result every member of that bloodline wants your head on
a plate. The effects of the Flaw may manifest as anything
from very public snubs and insults to actual attempts on
your unlife. You are also at +2 difficulty on all Social
rolls relating to members of the Clan in question.
