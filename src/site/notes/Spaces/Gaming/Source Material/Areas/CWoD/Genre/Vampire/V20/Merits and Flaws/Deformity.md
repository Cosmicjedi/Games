# Deformity
You have some kind of deformity — a misshapen
limb, hunchback, or clubfoot, for example — which
affects your physical abilities and interactions with
others. A hunchback, for instance, would lower a character’s
Dexterity by two dots and increase the difficulty
of die rolls relating to social skills by one. It is the responsibility
of the Storyteller to determine the specific
effects of the deformity chosen.
