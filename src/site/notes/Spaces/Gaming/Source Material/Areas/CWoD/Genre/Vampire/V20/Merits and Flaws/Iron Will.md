# Iron Will
When you are determined and your mind is set, nothing
can thwart you from your goals. Characters using
Dementation, Dominate, or any other mind-altering
magic, spell, or Thaumaturgy path against your character
are at +3 difficulty.
Elder levels of powers like Dementation and Dominate
may overwhelm even this resistance. Against
Level Six powers, the expenditure of a Willpower point
through Iron Will only raises the difficulty of the Discipline
roll by two. Against Level Seven powers, the difficulty
is increased by only one. Level Eight and higher
powers cannot be resisted with Iron Will.
This Merit does not affect Presence or other powers
dealing with the emotions. Characters will Willpower
scores below 8 cannot take this Merit.
