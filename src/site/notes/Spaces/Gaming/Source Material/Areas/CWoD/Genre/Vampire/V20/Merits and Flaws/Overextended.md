# Overextended
You’ve got your fingers in too many pies, and people
are starting to notice. You have too many ghouls, too
many retainers, or too much influence, which means
that a lot of people have a vested interest in trimming
back your operations. These enemies take every opportunity
to reduce your power and influence, and if that
means lying, cheating, or killing, so be it. Furthermore,
your enemies block every attempt you make to move
into new areas of control. You’re boxed in, and the box
is getting smaller.
