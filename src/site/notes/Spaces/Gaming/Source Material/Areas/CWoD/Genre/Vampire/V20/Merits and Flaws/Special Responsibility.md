# Special Responsibility
Shortly after your Embrace, you volunteered for
some task in order to gain respect and approval from
the vampires around you. Now, you wish you had never
opened your damn mouth! While you are not given
any special credit for performing this duty, you would
lose a lot of respect if you were to stop. The nature
and the details of your duty should be worked out with
the Storyteller in advance. Ideas can range from lending
money to other Kindred to acting as a messenger
or possibly gathering victims for ritae (such as Blood
Feasts).
