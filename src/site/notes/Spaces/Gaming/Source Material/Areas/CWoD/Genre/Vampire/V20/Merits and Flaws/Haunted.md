# Haunted
You are haunted by an angry and tormented spirit,
most likely one of your first victims. This spirit actively
attempts to hinder you, especially when feeding, and
does its utmost to vent its anguish upon you and anyone
in your presence. The Storyteller determines the
exact nature of the spirit, its powers, and whether or
not it can eventually be laid to rest.
