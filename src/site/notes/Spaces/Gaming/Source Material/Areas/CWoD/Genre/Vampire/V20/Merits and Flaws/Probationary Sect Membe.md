# Probationary Sect Member
You are a defector. You turned traitor to the Camarilla,
Sabbat, or other Sect, and you still have much to
prove before you are accepted by the Kindred you have
defected to. Other vampires treat you with distrust and
even hostility, and your reputation might even sully
those whom you regularly associate with.
