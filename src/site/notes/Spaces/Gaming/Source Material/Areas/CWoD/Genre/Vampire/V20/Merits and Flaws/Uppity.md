# Uppity
You are proud of your new status in the Sect — so
proud that you’ve shot your mouth off to other Kindred
and made some enemies. Wiser vampires laugh at you
and chalk your rudeness up to youth, but others find
you arrogant and insulting. These enemies will take action
to embarrass or harm you. Furthermore, you are
at +2 difficulty on all Social rolls against any vampires
you have alienated through your yammering — and
you may not know who they are.
At Storyteller discretion, you may also be required
to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to keep your
mouth shut any time the opportunity presents itself for
you to brag about your pack, your Clan, or your status.
