You were a small child (between five and 10 years
old) at the time of your Embrace, leaving your Physical
Attributes underdeveloped and making it difficult to
interact with some aspects of mortal society. You may
not have more than two dots in Strength or Stamina
at character creation, except when raising Physical Attributes
with blood points, and the difficulties of all die
rolls when attempting to direct or lead mortal adults
are increased by two. Characters with this Flaw should
also take the Short Flaw.
