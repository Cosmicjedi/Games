# Cursed
You are the recipient of a supernatural curse. The
strength and pervasiveness of the curse depend upon
how many points you wish to incur. Examples follow:
• If you pass on a secret you were entrusted with,
your betrayal will come back to harm you in some way.
(1 pt.)
• You stutter uncontrollably when you try to describe
what you have seen or heard. (2 pts.)
• Tools break or malfunction when you try to use
them. (3 pts.)
• You are doomed to make enemies of those whom
you most love or admire. (4 pts.)
• Every one of your accomplishments or triumphs
will eventually become soiled or fail in some way. (5
pts.)
Beacon of the Unholy (2pt. Flaw)
You radiate palpable evil. Clergy and devout mortals
know instinctively that there is something horribly
wrong with you, and react accordingly.
