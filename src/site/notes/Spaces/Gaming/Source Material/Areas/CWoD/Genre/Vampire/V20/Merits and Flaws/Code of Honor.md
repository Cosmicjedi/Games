# Code of Honor
You have a personal code of ethics to which you adhere.
The specifics of this code must be worked out with
the Storyteller prior to play, and the character must
follow it strictly. Characters with this Merit gain two
additional dice to all Willpower or Virtue rolls when
acting in accordance with their code (e.g., defending
the helpless) or when attempting to avoid situations
that might force them to violate their code.
