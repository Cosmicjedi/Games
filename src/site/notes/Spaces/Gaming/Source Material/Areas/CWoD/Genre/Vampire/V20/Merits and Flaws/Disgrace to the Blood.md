# Disgrace to the Blood
Your sire regards the fact that he Embraced you to
be a titanic mistake, and has let everyone know it. You
are mocked at gatherings, taunted by your peers, and
actively despised by the one who should be giving you
guidance. Any request or petition you make is likely to
be looked down upon by friends of your sire, and your
achievements are likely to be discounted.
