# Eidetic Memory
You remember, with perfect detail, things you see and
hear. Documents, photographs, conversations, etc.,
can be committed to memory with only minor concentration.
Under stressful conditions involving numerous
distractions, you must make a Perception + Alertness
roll (difficulty 6) to summon enough concentration to
absorb what your senses detect.
