# Monstrous
Your physical form was twisted during the Embrace,
and now reflects the Beast that rages inside you. Characters
with this Flaw appear to be savage monsters and
have Appearance ratings of zero. Nosferatu and other
bloodlines whose weaknesses cause them to start off
with Appearance zero cannot take this Flaw.
