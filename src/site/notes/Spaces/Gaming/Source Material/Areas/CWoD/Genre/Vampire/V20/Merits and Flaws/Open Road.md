Unlike many Kindred, you like to travel. You have
a solid knowledge of safe travel routes and methodologies,
not to mention haven space available in any number
of destinations. Unless someone out there knows
your exact route and is specifically looking for you, you
can move between cities unimpeded by random encounters
with Lupines, overzealous state troopers, and
the like.
