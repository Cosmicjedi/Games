# Failure
You once held a title in the city, but failed catastrophically
in your duties. Now you are branded incompetent,
excluded from circles of power and responsibility,
and generally ostracized by those on their way up. Your
exclusion may make you a target for recruitment by
the Sect’s enemies (or so the whispers run, making you
even more distrusted). Conversely, the consequences
of your error might come back to haunt you.
