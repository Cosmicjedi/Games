# New Arrival
You’ve just arrived in your new city of residence, and
don’t know anyone in the place. Existing factions may
try to recruit or eliminate you, while vampires in positions
of authority size you up and take your measure.
Meanwhile, your ignorance of the city’s current events,
history, and politics (not to mention the personality
quirks of the vampires already in place) may cause you
to make a serious blunder.
