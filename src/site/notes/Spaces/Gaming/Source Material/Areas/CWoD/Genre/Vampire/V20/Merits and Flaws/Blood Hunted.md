# Blood Hunted
You have been made the target of a blood hunt, and
for you to return to your home city is death. For four
points, this Flaw means that only your home city is offlimits
to you. For six, it means that the entire Camarilla
is howling for your vitae. This Flaw can only be
taken by Camarilla vampires.
