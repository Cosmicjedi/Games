# Addiction
You suffer from an addiction to a substance, which
must now be present in the blood you drink (or you
automatically frenzy, as per the Prey Exclusion Flaw).
This can be alcohol, nicotine, hard drugs, or simply
adrenaline. This substance always impairs you in some
fashion (see “Poisons and Drugs,” p. 301, for particulars).
