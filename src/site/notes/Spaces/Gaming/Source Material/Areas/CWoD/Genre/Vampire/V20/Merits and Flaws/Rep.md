Your fame has exceeded the bounds of your Sect. Everyone
knows who you are, what you’ve done and what
you’re supposed to have done (which might not be the
same thing). The publicity can be good or bad; what
matters is that everybody knows your name. Whether
individuals outside of your immediate social circle
know enough to match your face to your name is a different
matter.
