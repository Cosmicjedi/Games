# Disease Carrier
Your blood carries a lethal and highly contagious disease.
The disease can be anything from rabies to HIV,
and Kindred who drink your blood have a 10% chance
of becoming a carrier as well. You must spend an extra
blood point each night on awakening, or you will begin
manifesting symptoms of the disease (increased chance
to frenzy for rabies, reduced soak rolls for HIV, etc.).
