# Friend of the Underground
While you’re not a Nosferatu, you know your way
around the sewers, tunnels, ducts, subway tubes, and
other subterranean passages of your hometown. The local
Nosferatu (and any other creatures dwelling down
in the muck) may not actually like you, but they’re not
inclined to kill you on sight when they see you in their
territory. You are at -1 difficulty on any rolls involving
the subterranean world (sneaking from place to place
underground, finding routes into sub-basements, and
so on). Nosferatu cannot purchase this Merit.
