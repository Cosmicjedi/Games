# Elysium Regular
You spend an unusual amount of time in Elysium.
You see and are seen to such an extent that all of the
movers and shakers of Elysium at least know who you
are. Extended time spent in Elysium also gives you extended
opportunities to interact with the Harpies and
other Kindred of that stature — and they’ll know your
name when you approach them. This Merit is generally
taken by vampires that respect and attend Elysium
on a regular basis.
