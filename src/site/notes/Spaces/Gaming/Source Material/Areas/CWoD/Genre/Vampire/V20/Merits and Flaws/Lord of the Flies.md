# Lord of the Flies
Buzzing harbingers of decay swirl around you everywhere.
Their constant presence makes it difficult for
you to interact socially (+1 difficulty when appropriate)
and nearly impossible to sneak up on someone
or hide effectively. The buzzing of the flies inevitably
gives you away — all Stealth rolls are at +2 difficulty.
