# Flesh of the Corpse
Your flesh does not fully regenerate itself once it is
damaged. While you are able to heal yourself to the
point of regaining full functionality, your skin still
retains the cuts, tears, bullet holes, and other visible
damage that you have incurred. Depending on the nature
of the damage, this Flaw will make social dealings
exceedingly difficult, and may decrease your Appearance
dots over time (even to 0).
