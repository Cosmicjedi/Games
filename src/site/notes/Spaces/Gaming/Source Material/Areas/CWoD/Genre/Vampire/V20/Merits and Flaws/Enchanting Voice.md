# Enchanting Voice
There is something about your voice that others
cannot ignore. When you command, they are cowed.
When you seduce, they swoon. Whether thundering,
soothing, persuading, or simply talking, your voice commands
attention. The difficulties of all rolls involving
the use of the voice to persuade, charm, or command
are reduced by two.
