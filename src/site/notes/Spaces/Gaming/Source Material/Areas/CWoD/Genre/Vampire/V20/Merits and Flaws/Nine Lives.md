# Nine Lives
Fate has granted you the opportunity to come as
close to Final Death as anyone can get and still survive.
When a roll occurs that would result in your death, the
roll is made again. If the next roll succeeds, then you
live — and one of your nine lives is used up. If that
subsequent roll fails, then another reroll is made, until
either a successful roll occurs or your nine lives are used
up. The Storyteller should keep careful count of how
many lives the character has remaining.
