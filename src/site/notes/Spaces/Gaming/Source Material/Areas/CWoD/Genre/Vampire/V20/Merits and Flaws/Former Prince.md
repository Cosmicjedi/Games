# Former Prince
Once, you held near-absolute power in a city, but
those nights are gone now. Perhaps you stepped down,
perhaps you were deposed, or perhaps your city fell
to the Sabbat; it matters little in your reduced state.
What does matter is that the Prince in the city where
you now dwell is aware of your prior employment, and
has concerns that you might be trying to make a comeback.
The machinery of the Camarilla in the city where
you now make your home is subtly stacked against you,
and if the Prince sees an opportunity to get rid of you
he just might take it. This Flaw can only be taken by
Camarilla vampires.
