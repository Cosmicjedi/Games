# Narc
You are known to be a snitch, an informer firmly
planted in the pocket of the vampires in charge. Those
on whom you might yet inform loathe you as a result,
feeding you misinformation when they can in an attempt
to discredit you. Given the opportunity, they might do
you mischief. Regardless, your reputation as a weasel precedes
you, putting you at +1 difficulty on all Social rolls
against those who don’t agree with your politics.
