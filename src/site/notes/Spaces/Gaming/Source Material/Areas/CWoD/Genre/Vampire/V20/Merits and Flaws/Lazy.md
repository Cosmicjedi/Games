# Lazy
You are simply lazy, avoiding anything that requires
effort on your part. Preferring to let others do the hard
work, you lounge around. For any action that requires
preparation, there’s a good chance you didn’t properly
prepare. Difficulty rolls for spontaneous Physical actions
(including combat, unless it’s part of a planned
offensive) increase by one.
