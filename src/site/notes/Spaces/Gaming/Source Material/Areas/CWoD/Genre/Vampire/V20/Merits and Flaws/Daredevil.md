You are good at taking risks, and even better at surviving
them. When attempting exceptionally risky
non-combat actions (such as leaping from one moving
car to another), characters with this Merit add an additional
three dice to their rolls, and negate a single
botch die that may result from such a roll. Generally,
such actions must be at least difficulty 8 and have the
potential to inflict at least three health levels of damage
if failed.
