# Victim of the Masquerade
The Camarilla’s propaganda machine did too good a
job on you. Even after your Embrace you refused to believe
you were a vampire. You remain convinced that
there is some logical explanation for your condition,
and spend as much time as you can searching for it.
You also have problems feeding, and may insist on trying
to eat regular food. None of these habits makes you
particularly pleasant company for other Kindred. This
Flaw must be roleplayed at all times, and is generally
taken by Camarilla vampires.
