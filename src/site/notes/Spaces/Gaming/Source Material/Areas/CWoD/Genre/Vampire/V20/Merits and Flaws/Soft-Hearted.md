You cannot stand to watch others suffer. You avoid
any situation that involves causing someone physical
or emotional pain, unless you make a Willpower roll
(difficulty 8). You must have a Humanity rating of 7
or above to take this Flaw — vampires on Paths of Enlightenment
can only take this Flaw with Storyteller
approval.
