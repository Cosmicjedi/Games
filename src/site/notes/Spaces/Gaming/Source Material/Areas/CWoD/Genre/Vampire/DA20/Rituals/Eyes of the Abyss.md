# Eyes of the Abyss

With this ritual, the Abyss Mystic summons tiny denizens of the Abyss to act as her servants, most often being used as spies.
### System: 
The vampire crushes a small flame(e.g. a lit candle) in her bare hand, taking a level of aggravated damage.  She then makes a **Rötschreck** check, *difficulty 4.* If she succeeds, roll **Intelligence + Occult**, *difficulty 6*. 
A botch results in an additional level of aggravated damage. 
On a success, a tiny Abyss elemental is summoned and consumes the extinguished flame.

The creature remains a number of nights equal to the successes rolled. The elemental will respond to and obey all commands given by the caster. It cannot affect the material world, though it can communicate mentally by entering a person’s shadow. 

Any non-Mystic who communicates with an Abyss elemental in such a fashion must make a **Courage check**, *difficulty 6*. 
Failure results in a temporary Derangement that lasts the remainder of the evening. 
On a botch, the Derangement is permanent and can only be cured through repeated use of Willpower.

The elemental is always in shadow form (as [[Spaces/Gaming/Source Material/Areas/CWoD/Genre/Vampire/V20/Disciplines/Obtenebration#••••• Tenebrous Form|Tenebrous Avatar]], see p. 230), can fly 30 yards/meters per turn, and is instantly destroyed by fire or sunlight. 
***A level 2 version of this ritual, Talons of the Abyss, can summon shadow elementals that are corporeal and can even attack enemies.***
