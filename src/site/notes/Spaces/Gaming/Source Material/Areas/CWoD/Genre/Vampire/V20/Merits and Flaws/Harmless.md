# Harmless
Everyone in the city knows you, and knows that
you’re no threat to their plans. While that sort of estimation
may seem insulting, it’s also what’s kept you
from being killed. No one considers you worth their
time to deal with, and that low opinion keeps you safe.
If you start acting in a way that demonstrates that you
are no longer harmless, others’ reactions to you will
likely change as a result.
