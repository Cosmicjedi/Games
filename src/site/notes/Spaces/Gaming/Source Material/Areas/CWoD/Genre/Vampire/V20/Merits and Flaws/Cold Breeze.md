# Cold Breeze
A chill wind follows you everywhere you go. While
it may make for dramatic entrances, this effect also discomfits
mortals (+1 difficulty on all appropriate Social
rolls) and marks you as obviously supernatural. Cold
winds sweeping through executive offices or crowded
nightclubs can raise all sorts of questions.
Repulsed by Garlic (1pt. Flaw)
You cannot abide garlic, and the smallest whiff of its
scent will drive you from a room unless you make a successful
Willpower roll (difficulty based on the strength
of the odor).
