# One Eye
You have only one eye — which eye is missing is up
to you. The difficulties of all Perception rolls involving
eyesight are increased by two, and the difficulties of all
die rolls requiring depth perception are increased by
one (this includes ranged combat).
Vulnerability to Silver (2pt. Flaw)
To you, silver is as painful and as deadly as the rays of
the sun. You suffer aggravated wounds from any silver
weapons (bullets, knives, etc.), and the mere touch of
silver objects discomfits you.
