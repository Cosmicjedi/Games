# Sanctity
This Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone
considers you pure and innocent, though not
necessarily naïve. You have a saint-like quality that is
hard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. You are trusted,
even if you are not trustworthy. At the Storyteller’s
discretion, you tend to receive lesser punishments for
wrongdoing, and you are liked by most.
Scholar of Enemies (2pt. Merit)
You have taken the time to learn about and specialize
in one particular enemy of your Sect. You are aware
of at least some of the group’s customs, strategies, abilities,
and long-term goals, and can put that knowledge
to good use. This Merit is worth a -2 difficulty for all
non-combat rolls pertaining specifically to the subject
of your specialization. On the other hand, you are at a
+1 difficulty when it comes to dealing with other enemies,
simply because you’re so thoroughly focused on
your field.
