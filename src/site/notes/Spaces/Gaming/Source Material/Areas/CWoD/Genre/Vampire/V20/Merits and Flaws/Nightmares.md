# Nightmares
You experience horrendous nightmares every time
you sleep, and memories of them haunt you during
your waking hours. Upon awakening, you must make
a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) or lose a die on all actions
for that night. A botched Willpower roll indicates
that, even when awake, you still believe that you
are locked in a nightmare.
