# Primogen/Bishop Friendship (4pt. Merit)
The ruling vampires of the city value you and your
opinions. You are called in to consult on decisions, and
your recommendations carry great weight. Your position
may not be an official one, but it’s powerful nonetheless.
Botched Presentation (1pt. Flaw)
When your sire presented you to the Prince of the
city, you flubbed it. Now you’re convinced His Majesty
hates you (whether he does or not). You need to succeed
on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) just to stand in
front of the Prince or one of his duly authorized representatives
without running, blubbering, or otherwise
making a fool of yourself. This Flaw can only be taken
by Camarilla vampires.
