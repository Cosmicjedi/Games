# Old Flame
Someone you once cared deeply for is now with the
enemy. He still attempts to play on your sympathies
“for old times’ sake” while working against you. Unless
you succeed on a contested Manipulation + Expression
roll against your former friend, you cannot act against
him unless the situation becomes life-threatening.
