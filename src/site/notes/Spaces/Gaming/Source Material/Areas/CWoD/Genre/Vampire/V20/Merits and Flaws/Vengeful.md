# Vengeful
You have a score to settle, incurred either during
your mortal days or after the Embrace. You are obsessed
with taking your revenge on an individual or group,
and it is your overriding priority in any situation where
you encounter the object of your revenge. You may
temporarily resist your need for vengeance by spending
a Willpower point.
