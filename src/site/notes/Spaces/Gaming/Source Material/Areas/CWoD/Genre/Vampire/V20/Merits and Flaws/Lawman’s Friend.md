# Lawman’s Friend
For whatever reason (maybe your winning smile or
perhaps just your superb groveling technique), the local
Sheriff or Bishop in charge of discipline likes you.
He’s inclined to overlook your minor trespasses and let
you in on things you’re not supposed to know about.
He even gives you warnings about occasional crackdowns
and times when the higher-ups aren’t feeling
generous. Of course, abusing this connection might
well turn a friendly vampire into an enemy — and the
change might not be apparent until it’s too late.
