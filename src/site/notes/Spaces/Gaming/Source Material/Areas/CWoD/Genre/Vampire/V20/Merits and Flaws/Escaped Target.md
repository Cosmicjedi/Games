# Escaped Target
You had targeted a mortal for the Embrace, but
someone else got there first. You cannot stand the humiliation
of being cheated of your prize, and fly into a
rage (+2 difficulty to avoid frenzy) whenever you see
the one who got away. This hatred may lead you into
other irrational behaviors, like Embracing enemies of
the neonate, creating unauthorized childer, or even
trying to kill your rival. Furthermore, your petty and
irrational behavior is well-known and quite noticeable,
and as a result you are at + 1 difficulty on all Charisma
rolls until the situation is resolved.
