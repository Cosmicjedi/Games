# True Faith
You have a deep-seated faith in and love for God, or
whatever name you choose to call the Almighty. You
begin the game with one point of True Faith (see the
sidebar on p. 372); this Trait adds one die per point to
all Willpower and Virtue rolls. You must have a Humanity
of 9 or higher to choose this Merit, and if you
lose even a single point, all your Faith points are lost
and may be regained only when the lost Humanity is
recovered. Individuals with True Faith are capable of
performing magical acts akin to miracles, but the exact
nature of those acts are up to the Storyteller.
