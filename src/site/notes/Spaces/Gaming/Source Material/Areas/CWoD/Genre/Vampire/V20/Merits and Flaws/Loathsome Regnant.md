# Loathsome Regnant
Not only are you blood bound, but you are also in
thrall to a vampire who mistreats you hideously. Perhaps
you are publicly abused or humiliated; perhaps
your master forces you to commit unspeakable acts for
him. In any case, existence under the bond is a neverending
nightmare, with your regnant serving to conduct
the symphony of malice. Sabbat vampires cannot
take this Flaw.
