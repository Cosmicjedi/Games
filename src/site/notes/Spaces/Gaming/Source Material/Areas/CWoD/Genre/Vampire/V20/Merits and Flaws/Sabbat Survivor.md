# Sabbat Survivor
You’ve lived through at least one Sabbat attack or
attempted recruitment. Your experience helps you
anticipate situations where you might potentially
be endangered by the Sabbat once again. You are at
-1 difficulty on all Perception rolls when it comes to
Sabbat-based matters. This Merit is generally taken by
groups in conflict with the Sabbat, and comes into play
most frequently as a means of avoiding ambushes.
