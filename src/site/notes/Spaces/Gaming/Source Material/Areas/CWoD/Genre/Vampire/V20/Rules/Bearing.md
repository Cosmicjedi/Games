# Bearing
A vampire’s morality has a direct impact on
her bearing — a feeling the Kindred unconsciously
projects. The greater the vampire’s
Humanity or Path rating, the stronger this tendency
is. For example, vampires on Humanity
have a bearing of normalcy; the humane connection
that such vampires hold keeps them
from seeming strange and terrifying to mortals.
Generally, a vampire’s bearing has little or no
direct effect on her nightly activities — it’s
only a vague impression. Very high or low
morality ratings impose a bonus or penalty to
specific rolls associated with the character’s
bearing — for Humanity, the bearing modifier
affects Social rolls for appearing normal and
winning sympathy. These modifiers can affect
rolls used for Disciplines, where relevant. Paths
of Enlightenment have their own bearings,
which are listed with each Path description.
