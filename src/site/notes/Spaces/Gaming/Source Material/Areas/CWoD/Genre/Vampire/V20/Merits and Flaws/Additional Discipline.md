# Additional Discipline
You can take one additional Discipline (Storyteller
discretion) as if it were a Clan Discipline. All costs
to learn that Discipline are paid out as if it were native
to your Clan. A character cannot take this Merit
more than once, and Caitiff vampires cannot take this
Merit.
