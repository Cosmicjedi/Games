                   Mutantkind in the World of Darkness
                                by the Poet
                                                         Updated 2010/06/18

His eyes opened involuntarily, as they had for thousands of previous
days, but this time it was a little harder than before.

The eyelids pressed resolutely open through the green gel that
surrounded him in the tank, and he drew his first conscious breath.  The
gel that he was forced to breathe was so thick that it was dangerous to
inhale too quickly, or with too much force.  Slowly, gently.  In and
out.  Keep the heartbeat low.

Naturally, his heartrate spiked as soon as his eyes focused on the room
beyond the tank, the lab in which he was suspended.  While the speaker
wasn't turned on (and the gel naturally absorbed sound), he couldn't
hear the commotion.  He could, however, see another tank being smashed
from the outside.

How was that even possible?  Adamantium-laced glass.  These tanks were
purchased from Crypt, as he understood it.  Taken directly from the
Department. Short of the Hulk, who could shatter it?

The gel in the alternate tank was sloughing off of the naked body of one
of his cohabitants.  He couldn't make it out through the blur of his own
gel, and the tank wall.  Why hadn't someone turned on the correct light?

He winced, and winced again with the resulting pain in his lungs, when
he saw another figure surge forward and collect something from the glass
shards on the floor.  The figure used whatever it was to slash open the
throat and chest of his companion.  The slashing figure was fighting
using an economical grace that reminded him of... of...

The Shade?  Was that the name?  A larger man.  Not formally trained in
any fancy martial art, but as deadly in combat as anyone.  Still, how
did he know the Shade?  Hmmm.  Memory was a little spotty.  Maybe asleep
for a long time.

He almost vomited, this time with a strange spike of emotion.  Fear,
perhaps. The figure used the item to destroy another tank, and was
stabbing its occupant over and over.  Blood.  Lots of it.

Fear was a little familiar, but not a common emotion.  Perfectly rational
in view of the circumstances, of course.  That was another death.  The
figure seemed to be growing less graceful, more violent, if that was
possible.  His next companion was stabbed and sliced and separated with a
kick.

What form of hatred could this be?  Who was the figure here to find?  Or
kill?

Now the figure approached.  The item it wielded... a knife!  Adamantium
knife!  Department H?  Wakandan?  Who?  How?

The knife entered the gel through the glass, parting it like butter, and
the gel collapsed away from his body.  It made a noise like a wet towel
as it hit the ground.

The figure (a man) kicked him in the stomach, and he fell to his knees.

"S-s-", he cried, trying to yell, "Stop", but instead he vomited the gel
from his stomach.  He coughed it from his lungs.  On hands and knees.

The man grabbed him by something that he couldn't feel, but it pulled
him almost upright.  Something like... wires attached to his head.  The
man slashed with that deadly knife, and he ducked, and the knife caught
the wires.  Two were pulled free, jerking from his head.  A few were
cut, but many wires held in place.

He couldn't tell where the breathing was coming from.  Was it him?  Or
the man?

"Stop!" he shouted, and looked the man in the eye.  He looked the man in
the eye, and the man stopped.  His voice wasn't just the voice of the one,
it was the voice of the many, and it carried power.  Even this man, at
least in his current state, could not resist it.  The man froze in place,
and the colour of those eyes seemed to change.

Now, he remembered.  Voice of power and all.

He sighed, sinking to a sitting position.  Perhaps he was in the tank to
maintain a state of quiet, and remove memories and thoughts as they came
to him, but now a critical bit of wiring was detached.  With a second
sigh, he pulled the remainder free.

Elliot.  That's who he was.  Son of the Shade, herald of Apocalypse,
servant of Sinister.

More's the pity for this man.  And maybe, the world.

books, the Marvel Superheroes Roleplaying Game by TSR, the Heroes Unlimited

Step 1: Creation
   Attributes: 7/5/3
   Abilities: 13/9/5
   Powers: 6 Ranks
   Backgrounds: 5
   Willpower: 3
   Power Potential: 3
   Actual Power Level: 3
   Power Charge: initial value equal to Actual Power Level

Pick Power/Attribute Categories:

Powers
	The mutant first must pick her primary Power category (Physical,
	Social, or Mental).  Power Ranks in this category are improved at a
	rate of 6 times the current rating. Power Stunts cost only 3 Experience
	points for Primary powers.

	The mutant may then choose one of the two remaining categories as her
	secondary Power category.  Secondary category Powers are improved at a
	cost of 8 times the current rating.  Power Stunts cost 5 Experience
	points for secondary Powers.

	The remaining category will be the mutant's tertiary Power category. 
	The mutant may choose one or more powers from it;  however, these may
	not be improved with Experience save to purchase new Power Stunts,
	which cost a full 7 Experience points a piece.

	A new Power, if the character gets the opportunity during the game to
	purchase one, costs 10 points in the primary or secondary Power
	category, and 15 points in the tertiary Power category.

	If the mutant's primary Power category is Physical, he may purchase
	extra health levels, as the Power, with experience points.

	If the mutant's primary Power category is Mental, he may purchase the
	Iron Will Power with Experience, even if he did not start the game
	with it.

	If the mutant's primary Power category is Social, he may receive one
	or more points in each expendable advantage at the start of every game
	session.  This includes Willpower and Power Charge, as well as any
	other advantages bestowed by other Powers (Rage, for example).  This
	will typically be within the range of one to five points each; the
	Storyteller may assign these, or may ask the player to roll a die and
	halve the result (rounding up) to get a range of 1-5.

Attributes
	The mutant's primary Power category (Physical, Social, or Mental) is
	one in which he can exceed the 5-point limit with experience points. 
	Attributes in other categories may exceed 5, but only as an expression
	of powers. This category need not be the one you chose to spend 7
	points on in character creation.  The normal maximum score for an
	Attribute increased in this way is 10.

Power Potential and Actual Power Level
	The Power Potential represents the mutant's maximum potential; how
	great she may some day become.  It is always at least equal to the
	Actual Power Level, and represents the ultimate limit of Rank that the
	mutant can achieve in her Powers.  This level is set at the end of
	character creation and can't be improved with Experience; it will not
	exceed 10.  Normal level (to make what Marvel refers to as Alpha-Class)
	is 5.

	The Actual Power Level is the current ceiling for the mutant's Power
	Ranks.  This level can be improved with Experience to eventually match
	the Power Potential.

Power Allocation
	The mutant may start with no more than 4 Powers in any case (exception:
	see the Alter Ego Power).  Mega Attributes and Hyper-Abilities do not
	count against this limit.  Powers bought with Experience do not count
	against this limit, either.

Power Ranks
	If the Power listing shows only one Rank (like ¥ or ¥¥¥¥) then that is
	the cost of the Power, and it can never be improved.  If the Ranks only
	go up to a certain point less than 5 (like Rage, which goes to ¥¥¥) it
	cannot be improved past that point.  
	
	Note: most Powers are only described to Rank 5 in the text, but can be
	improved past that point.

Power Variations
	Some Powers have optional variations, which can be purchased with a
	few extra Freebie points.  These variations may also return Freebie
	points if they weaken the Power.  Some listings require that you pick
	a variation (like the Absorption/Conversion Powers).  All of the energy
	Powers (except Energy Resistance) require that you pick a type of
	energy from the Energy List.  Those energies marked with an asterisk
	(*), much like Powers with such a mark, cost double to purchase.  Thus,
	Energy Channeling (Balefire) costs twice as much to buy and improve
	with Experience than Energy Channeling (Fire).

Power Stunts
	A Power Stunt is a trick that you can do with your Power (or a special
	variation on the Power which might only be available at character
	creation) once you achieve a certain Rank.  The Rank of the Power
	Stunt is the Rank that you need in the Power before you can use it. 
	Some Power Stunts have prerequisites; these Stunts or Powers must be
	purchased, if possible, before that Stunt can be bought or even
	developed.  A Stunt can be bought with Experience in the following
	manner: first, get all of the stuff you need to buy it (proper Rank,
	all prerequisites).  Then, attempt it successfully (if possible) at
	least five times, each time at the cost of a Willpower point.  Once
	that is done, the mutant may purchase the Stunt with Experience.  If
	the Stunt cannot be tried out before it is bought, the mutant spends
	five Willpower in one lump sum (or over time) and then purchases it
	with the Experience.  Once a Stunt is bought, it can be used in future
	(usually) without expending Willpower.

Active vs. Passive Powers
	All the Powers in this supplement (and some of the variants and Power
	Stunts, too) are marked with letters in square brackets.  For example,
	the Power: Telepathy has [AH] after its name.  The first letter in
	these brackets is an indicator of mitochondrial activity.  The second,
	a measure of concentration, is treated below.

	Essentially, mutants typically have strange cellular structure (owing
	to their strange DNA).  This allows them to have weird abilities like
	Energy Emission, etc.  The fuel source for these Powers is the
	mitochondria.  They give off an energy pattern (called a 'mutant
	signature') that is detectable to certain Powers and sophisticated
	equipment.

	Most Powers are active, which means that some part of the Power's
	operation requires a burst of energy from the mitochondria.  This is
	true even of Energy Absorption/Conversion- energy is used to change
	the nature of the energy the mutant absorbs!  Note that this energy is
	metabolic in nature, and is expressed in a certain pattern.  This
	pattern is unique to the mutant, but has many features in common with
	the patterns expressed by other mutants.  Thus, these patterns can be
	detected and suppressed.

	Passive Powers are different.  They require no special metabolic
	energy when the Power is used.  Body Weaponry is an example of this. 
	All of the mitochondrial energy of this type was exerted in creating
	the Weaponry. It is not required to maintain its existence, or to 'pop
	the claws'.

	Thus, if the mutant is exposed to a Power Dampening Field, it is very
	likely that his active Powers will be suppressed.  However, it is also
	likely that his passive Powers will continue to work.  For example,
	Logan loses the use of his Healing Factor when exposed to such an
	effect, but not his claws.

	Passive Powers are also more difficult to copy using Power Mimicry,
	etc. The difficulty to do such a thing is two higher than normal.

	Active Powers, naturally, are indicated with an 'A'.  Passive Powers
	are indicated with a 'P'.

	Note that most Power Stunts (except ones that change the nature of the
	Power) are active, even if the Power itself is passive.  Mere
	permanent physical changes (such as making a set of Body Weaponry
	retractable) are still passive.

	Note also that some Powers are marked with two or more letter pairs. 
	This means that the Power operates either actively or passively at the
	ST's discretion.  This won't usually change over time, so ask for a
	ruling when you take the Power.  It may also mean that some uses of
	the Power are active, and some are passive.

Concentration Levels
	As mentioned above, all Powers in this supplement are marked with two
	letters in square brackets.  The second letter in each pair denotes
	the concentration level.  For example, Energy Emission is marked with
	[AL].

	There are three levels of concentration, which basically denote how
	much attention the mutant has to pay to the Power when it is in use. 
	High concentration Powers (marked with an 'H') take a very intense
	level of attention.  Telepathy is a high-concentration Power.  The
	mutant can do nothing more complicated than walking around, talking,
	etc. with this Power, and cannot split her dice pool (except in
	special circumstances).  In the case of effects that she is
	concentrating to maintain, her concentration can be disrupted by a
	physical attack that successfully hits.  Most of these maintenance
	effects, however, allow her to split her dice pool.

	Low-concentration Powers (marked with an 'L') are the most common
	kind. The mutant has to think to activate it, and use what is referred
	to as light concentration to maintain it.  Light concentration
	maintenance effects with usually either require a split of dice pool
	(usually equating only to the loss of one die to the other action- no
	new roll is usually required to maintain the concentration) or an
	increase in diffs to all new actions.  Many low-concentration Powers
	do not require or feature such maintenance effects.  Dice pools can
	nearly always be split to perform multiple actions in conjunction with
	this Power, as per normal.  It is difficult to disrupt this level of
	concentration; no easier than for any other action that the mutant
	might attempt.

	No-concentration Powers (marked with an 'N') are the most desirable.
	They require negligible concentration, or none at all.  Frequently,
	such a Power is involuntary.  Wolverine's claws are an example of
	this.  Of course, certain uses of this Power may require normal
	actions - like attacking with the claws, for instance.  Usually, no
	dice pool split is required to use this Power.  It is automatic, and
	impossible to disrupt the concentration required using normal means. 
	Complete unconsciousness frequently does the trick, though...

	Note also that some Powers are marked with two or more letter pairs. 
	This means that the Power operates either at one concentration level
	or another at the ST's discretion.  This won't usually change over
	time, so ask for a ruling when you take the Power.  It may also mean
	that some uses of the Power require a lower level of concentration,
	and some require a higher level.

Power Charge
	To those thoughtful souls who kept telling me that mutants needed an
	exhaustible attribute to draw power from (notably John Benner and
	David Okum), I finally bow my head and admit the truth.  The Power
	Charge is an Advantage that is similar, in some ways, to the Blood
	Pool of vampires or the Gnosis of werewolves.  Being that mutants
	don't necessarily have the physical advantages enjoyed by those two
	races, however, it was necessary to modify the concept a bit.

	Power Charge has an initial value (at character creation time) equal
	to the mutant's Actual Power Level.  At no time can the Power Charge
	be any higher than the Power Potential, except with the use of the
	Power: Juju Focus or Charge Building.  In essence, the Power Charge
	represents the mutant's energy reserves.  Any active Power is subject
	to its effects.

	On the character sheet, you will notice that there are circles to fill
	in to denote the permanent level of the mutant's Power Charge.  There
	are also squares to denote the temporary level.  Yes, this is an
	expendable resource.  The mutant's temporary Power Charge can be
	expended in two ways: voluntarily and involuntarily.

	A voluntary expenditure of a point of Power Charge will decrease the
	difficulty of the mutant's next roll to use a Power by one.  It can
	also be spent in place of Willpower for Powers that require a
	Willpower expenditure to function (such as Horror Factor).  Note that
	only one point of Power Charge can be spent per round in this way.

	The other, less salutary way to lose a point of Power Charge is to
	botch a roll to use a Power.  This includes damage rolls for Energy
	Powers as well as activation rolls.

	Power Charge points are precious, however; the mutant's current level
	in temporary Power Charge is also the maximum level of output that he
	can manage.  So, if a mutant normally has a Power Charge of four, and
	then spends a point, all of his Powers immediately function at a Rank
	three level.

	Powers that are of fixed Rank (such as Invisibility) or have a minimum
	Rank (such as Photographic Reflexes) will cease to function once the
	temporary Power Charge dips below the Rank of that Power.  Therefore,
	if a mutant who had Photographic Reflexes and Invisibility were ever to
	have a temporary Power Charge of 3 or less, he would lose the use of
	those Powers until his Power Charge returned to more normal levels
	(four or higher).

	Note that passive Powers are in no way affected by Power Charge, no
	matter how low the score dips.  A mutant's Conditional Immortality and
	Body Armour will continue to function even when his physical reserves
	are completely gone.  Note, however, that many Power Stunts are not
	passive, but active, and some of these may be unavailable to the 
	mutant if his Power Charge dips too low.

	Power Charge regenerates naturally at a rate of one point per day.

	After character creation, Power Charge must be improved with
	Experience points at a rate of 2 x current.  Once again, Power Charge
	cannot exceed the mutant's Power Potential.

	For example, the Shade has a Shadow Brawl of four, Shadow Firearms of
	three, and three extra Health Levels.  He has an Actual Power Level of
	five and a Power Charge of five.  He is in dire straits fighting a
	trio of Dire Wraiths.

	In the first round, Adam spends a point of Power Charge to decrease
	his difficulties to blast a Dire Wraith with Shadow Firearms.  His
	roll succeeds and the Dire Wraith is killed.  He now has four points
	of temporary Power Charge remaining.

	In the second round, he attempts to get fancy with Shadow Brawl and
	punches a Dire Wraith in a critical area.  He botches his roll badly,
	and sucks in his breath as the biofeedback hits him, draining his
	reserves.  He now has a Power Charge of three, which means that his
	Shadow Brawl only functions at Rank three.  Of course, his Shadow
	Firearms and Extra Health Levels are unaffected.

	In the third round, desperate after taking heavy damage, the Shade
	spends another point of Power Charge to decrease his difficulties with
	Shadow Brawl.  He manages to deal one of his opponents a lethal blow,
	but his Power Charge is now two.  Both his Shadow Brawl and his Shadow
	Firearms are affected, and function at a Rank two level.  His Extra
	Health Levels, fortunately, are a passive Power.  They are not
	affected by the loss of temporary Power Charge.

	With a critical drain in Power, Adam may be in trouble against the
	sole remaining Dire Wraith...

The Effects of Damage
	Mutants do not, of themselves, have a substance that is their weakness.
	Some individuals may, through flaws, have this problem.  Moreover,
	unlike mages, they are capable of soaking aggravated damage.  However,
	mutants, like mages and other humans, may also be killed by lethal, or 
	'normal' damage.

"Pushing The Envelope"
	In times of utter desperation, a mutant can attempt to push the
	envelope and force out more power than her body can comfortably
	channel.  Basically, the mutant must spend Health Levels to
	temporarily increase the Rank of one of her Powers to her Power
	Potential.  This is related to the common Stunt Kamikaze Burst (which
	is an energy Stunt, usually), but can also be used with physical
	Powers, etc.  This increase lasts one round, usually, or until the
	action that the mutant is trying to perform is finished. If the action
	takes more than one round, it costs a Health Level per round in
	addition to the original cost.  The mutant will be incapacitated for
	some time afterwards- see the table below.  As an example:

	Elliot, the famous nephilim mutant, is an X.S.E. officer facing off
	against Rachel Summers!  Rather predictably, he is in enormous trouble
	and will shortly die unless he takes desperate action.  Fortunately,
	Elliot is a Product of Sinister(tm) and thus has an excessive Power
	Potential (8).  He spends rather a lot of Health Levels and pushes his
	Size-Shifting to Rank 8.  His next punch blasts through Ray's TK
	defenses and puts her down.  Whew!

	Unfortunately, when Elliot shrinks down the next round, he suffers a
	massive and crippling heart attack, leaving him lying face down in the
	wet mud.  The price: a permanent point of Stamina.

	The price may be nothing, or it may be nasty (as in Elliot's case)- it
	all depends on the ST's discretion and the circumstances.  In any
	case, the mutant will be incapacitated for some time after using this
	ability:

	If the mutant pushed up the Power by one Rank: Helpless for two rounds
	Two Ranks:                                     Four rounds
	Three Ranks:                                   One scene
	Four Ranks:                                    One hour
	Five Ranks:                                    One day
	Six Ranks:                                     One week
	Seven Ranks (not recommended):                 One month
	Eight Ranks:                                   Six months & loss of Power
	Nine Ranks:                                    One year and loss of Power

New Powers and Experience
	Most of the time, a new Power cannot be bought.  There are several
	Power Stunts which make exceptions of this rule, and the Merit: Hidden
	Power also serves as an exception.  Campaign circumstances may dictate
	that the Storyteller allow a player the opportunity to buy a certain
	Power with Experience.  This is entirely at the ST's discretion.

	Some Powers cannot be improved with Experience- for instance, most of
	the Altered Perceptions Powers.  It would also be difficult to imagine
	how the mutant would increase her rating in Body Weaponry, but if a
	good reason comes up, so be it.

	has final say on whether a particular Merit or Flaw is allowed.


							Power Categories

	The thing that sets a mutant (homo sapiens superior) apart from a
	normal human (homo sapiens sapiens) is his Powers.  All human beings
	have a great deal of 'junk' DNA in their genetic makeup.  This 'junk'
	DNA does not seem to do anything for the development and health of its
	carrier.  One part of this DNA is an area that has been identified as
	the X-factor- named after the scientist who discovered it, Charles
	Francis Xavier.  In normal humans, the X-factor is dormant.  In
	mutants, however, this region is very important.  It is the source of
	their Powers.

	This game features three basic kinds of Powers: physical, social, and
	mental.  Some Powers cross over into two or even all three categories.
	Mutants may have Powers in any or all of these categories, but it is
	more common for them to have all of their Powers in a single category.
	The difference between them is reflected in the experience costs for
	each of the categories.  Each mutant has a primary, secondary, and
	tertiary category.  Siege, for instance, has physical as his primary,
	social as his secondary, and mental as his tertiary. Improving
	physical Powers with experience costs 6 x current for Siege, while
	social Powers cost 8 x current, and mental Powers cannot be improved. 
	Axis, on the other hand, has mental as his primary, social as his
	secondary, and physical as his tertiary.  Mental powers only cost 6 x
	current for him.

							*****************


Anyone who downloaded an early version of the 'mutant.txt' file may have 
noticed one big, glaring fault- NO EXAMPLE OF CHARACTER CREATION!  Oops.  
Thanks, Scott, for pointing this out.  Anyway, for our example we will use 
the first character that was created using this system, Siege.

Keith is a big fan of Bishop, so he decided that he wanted his character
to be similar in powers and appearance.  It's probably best to work up a 
concept for a character before assigning numbers.  Seth Davis (the name of 
the character) was going to be a successful gang member from the city of 
Calgary, in Canada.  He came from a poor background, and helped support his 
single mom by acting as a gun-runner and enforcer for various criminal 
elements in the city.  Already, you can see that Seth is probably going to 
be a combat-ready guy who will be more ruthless than most of the heroes in 
the comics.

The first step (character concept) being complete, Keith fleshed out Seth 
by assigning his Attribute points, electing to make him a Physical character
(so he could exceed the five-point limit with Freebies or Experience).  He
doled out the points as follows: 7 to Physical, 5 to Mental, 3 to Social.
This fell out as follows:

STR: 4      CHR: 3      PER: 3
DEX: 3      MAN: 1      INT: 2
STA: 3      APP: 2      WIT: 3

Seth is physically impressive, but not terribly smart.  He is something
of a straight shooter (Manipulation 1) who prefers speaking bluntly to
dancing around an issue.  With his mutant Powers, perhaps he never needed
to lie to people in order to protect himself.

Rather than go with assigning the character's Abilities right away, as 
is the normal procedure, Keith decided that the skills that Seth had chosen 
to develop would probably have had a great deal to do with which Powers he 
was heir to.  Therefore, he immediately skipped to choosing Powers.

Since Seth was a Physical character, he decided that his primary Power
category would also be Physical.  Seeing as he wanted Seth to have Powers
similar to Bishop's, Keith chose the Social category as his secondary,
leaving Mental as the tertiary.

Looking over the list of Powers, Keith chose Energy Absorption/Conversion 
as his first Power.  Looking under the variations available, he chose the
Energy Conversion variation, which meant that he would convert any energy
attack into a specific energy form to be redirected at his opponents.  He
looked to the Energy List.  Not wanting to make this a double-cost Power,
Keith ignored energy types such as Nexus Force and Balefire, electing to
convert energy attacks to plasma.

Since Seth's primary category was Physical, Keith decided to look over 
the Physical Powers, and found one that would complement his other Power 
quite well.  It would also explain why he made such an effective gangster.
He took the Power: Force Absorption/Conversion with the Strength variation
as his second Power.

Not wanting to spread Seth too thin, Keith decided that two Powers was
quite enough, and assigned three Ranks to each- matching his Actual Power
Level.  If he had wanted to make one of these Powers a Rank higher, then
he would have had to improve his Actual Power Level to four using Freebie
points.

Keith continued to ignore the Ability assignment, and chose his 
Backgrounds.  He looked over the list, and then decided that he wanted 
Seth to have a close relationship with Charles Xavier.  He spent a full 
five points on the Mentor background to get Chuck on his team.

Finally, Keith turned to his Abilities.  Keeping his character concept 
in mind, Keith decided that Seth wouldn't have much education, so he left 
only 5 points to go into Knowledges.  Seeing as Streetwise, Intimidation, 
and Brawl were all in Talents (and these would be important skills to 
Seth), he assigned 13 points to Talents and 9 to Skills.  His choices fell 
out as follows:

Talents: Alertness 2 Athletics 2 Brawl 3 Dodge 2 Intimidation 2 
     Streetwise 2
Skills: Directed Blast 2 Firearms 3 Melee 3 Stealth 1
Knowledges: Area Knowledge 1 Enigmas 1 Investigation 1 Linguistics 1 
     Medicine 1

He justified his purchases as follows: all of the Talents would be vital
to a street survivor.  Likewise, all of the Skills except Directed Blast,
which he would need to use his Energy Absorption/Conversion Power.  He got
Area Knowledge from gun-running, and Enigmas from his practice in trying
to puzzle out what his enemies were going to do next.  Investigation he
put in as part and parcel of gang life, like finding out who shot up Mikey.
Seth learned French (Linguistics 1) while running guns in Quebec, and
Medicine while tending the wounds of his gang brothers.

Keith noted Seth's initial Willpower (3) on the sheet before turning
to Freebie points, of which he had 15.  He assigned them as follows:

Wanting Seth to be an epic mutant someday, he spent six points boosting
his Power Potential to six.  He also blew three points improving his
Willpower- bringing the total up to six.  He spent four points improving
his Brawl and Melee to four (after getting the Storyteller's permission
to increase an Ability to a level above three), leaving him with two
Freebies left.  Finally, he decided to push his Firearms up to four as
well, killing the last two points.  This left Seth with no Power Stunts
to start off with, but seeing as his Powers were both reactive (requiring
the actions of others to set them off) this was not unreasonable.

As Keith did not improve his Actual Power Level, Seth's Power Charge was 
set to three also.

Thus, Seth ended up looking something like this:

Name: Seth Davis
Codename: Siege

STR: 4      CHR: 3      PER: 3
DEX: 3      MAN: 1      INT: 2
STA: 3      APP: 2      WIT: 3

Alertness 2     D. Blast 2     Area Know. 1
Athletics 2     Firearms 4     Enigmas 1
Brawl 4         Melee 4        Investigation 1
Dodge 2         Stealth 1      Linguistics 1
Intimidation 2                 Medicine 1

								POWERS


Accelerated Recovery (Physical) [AN]
	This Power is similar to Healing Factor (though not as powerful in
	that sphere), but is especially useful to Willpower junkies and
	mutants with Rage.  Essentially, the mutant recovers at least one 
	point of Rage, one point of Willpower, or one Health Level per hour- 
	assuming that any damage that the mutant has taken is not aggravated.
	Moreover, the mutant never loses dice from his Stamina pool for any
	reason, even for debilitating poisons or normal dice penalties for
	accumulated damage.  No roll is required to use this Power.  Note
	that this Power does not recover Rage for mutants who do not have
	that Power!
	
	¥ The mutant recovers one point of any advantage (Health Levels, Rage,
	Willpower, Power Charge, Gnosis, etc.) every hour.
	¥¥ The mutant recovers two points per hour.  These points can be
	assigned in any combination (two Health Levels, one Health and one
	Rage, two Willpower, etc.).
	¥¥¥ Three points per hour.  The mutant also recovers one Health
	Level of aggravated damage per day.
	¥¥¥¥ Four points per hour.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points per hour.  One of these points can be applied to a
	level of aggravated danage.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six points per hour.  Two levels of aggravated damage can be
	healed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven points per hour.  Three levels of aggravated damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight points per hour.  Four levels of aggravated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Full recovery, every hour.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Permanent losses of Stamina, Willpower, etc. can be
	restored at an Exp. cost of 1 x current rather than the normal
	cost.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Shake off- the mutant may resist the effects of stuns, soporifics
	and other drugs many times faster than normal; if the effect normally
	lasts an hour, it only lasts a few minutes on the mutant.  If its time
	is measured in minutes, the effect is reduced to a matter of rounds.
	¥¥ No fatigue- any Stamina checks for muscle endurance or fatigue
	are considered to succeed completely (one success for every die in the
	pool).
	¥¥¥ Hold off- the mutant's sterling powers of recovery prevent her
	from feeling the effects of injuries until the end of the round in
	which she receives them-- dice penalties are not applied until the
	beginning of the next round.
	¥¥¥ Mega-Stamina- you may purchase the Power: Mega-Stamina with
	Experience.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Bounce Back- Spend a Power Charge and you may roll your Stamina
	(as your only action in a round) to recover up to your Rank in Health
	Levels, so long as you're recovering bashing damage.

Adhesion (Physical) [AN/AL]
	Adhesion has a variety of uses, but chiefly one climbs walls with
	it.  Spider-man, and his clone Kaine, are two people who have the
	ability to stick to things.  No roll is normally required, but a
	Strength + Adhesion to test the mutant's grip is not unheard of,
	nor is a Dexterity + Adhesion to stop a fall.
	
	¥ Enough to bear 200 lbs. of weight- maybe you!  Can't be pulled off
	by a character of less than 3 Strength.
	¥¥ Enough to bear 400 lbs. of weight.  Can't be removed except by the
	application of at least 4 Strength, or two 3 Strength characters.
	¥¥¥ 600 lbs.  Requires 5 Strength to remove, or two 4 Strength people.
	¥¥¥¥ 800 lbs.  Requires 6 Strength to remove, or two 4 Strength people.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 1000 lbs.  Requires 7 Strength to remove, or two 5 Strength folk.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ One ton.  Strength 8, or two Strength 6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Five tons.  Strength 9, or two Strength 7.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Ten tons.  Strength 10, or two Strength 7.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Fifty tons.  Strength 11, or two Strength 9.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ One hundred tons.  Strength 13, or two Strength 11.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Catch!- the mutant can add his Adhesion Rank in dice to any dice
	pool for catching things.
	¥ Extra-sticky- the mutant may choose to deliberately stick something
	to himself and forget it, so that it remains adhered even if he loses
	consciousness.  It's often a good idea to do this with your mask. This
	is a Stamina + Adhesion roll (diff 6).  A similar roll is required to
	let go.
	¥¥ Pull it apart- rather than hold his own weight, Kaine uses this
	stunt to pull down walls on people and perform other feats of wonder.
	Add the Adhesion dice to any Strength dice pool used to perform such
	a feat.
	¥¥¥ Heat wave- by activating his adhesion power and rubbing his hands
	against an object, the mutant can create enough friction to cause bad
	burns (one die of damage per Rank), though he must have sufficient
	strength to do so.  The mutant also takes this damage, but the diff.
	to soak is only 5.
	¥¥¥¥ Repulsion- the mutant can purchase the Power: Matter Repulsion
	with Experience.  In essence, he learns to reverse the attractive
	forces of his Adhesion.
	¥¥¥¥ Skin Sucking- by adhering to a victim's skin and then yanking, 
	the mutant can effectively flay the victim (yech!)  This does four
	dice of damage (diff 8 to soak) and also eliminates two dice from
	the victim's soak pool (does not affect the roll to soak this effect).
	Won't work on Colossus, of course.

Adrenal Vampirism (Physical) [AL]
	This Power allows a mutant to leech away the metabolic energy of others.
	He can absorb (at least temporarily) another person's Strength and
	Stamina, augmenting his own.  The main requirement of this Power is that
	the victim have an equivalent body chemistry; a mutant cannot steal the
	metabolic energy of a Skrull or a reptile.  Each point drained from the
	victim's Strength is added to the mutant's own, but he cannot augment
	his own Strength beyond his natural Strength + Power Potential; the
	same is true of Stamina.  The mutant cannot absorb a person's last
	point of Strength or Stamina, nor can he absorb Mega-Strength or
	Mega-Stamina (so if a character with Mega-Strength 4 was drained to
	the dregs, he would still have a Strength of 5) or bonuses from such
	Powers as Sizeshifting or Matter Body.
	
	¥ The mutant rolls his Stamina + Adrenal Vampirism (diff 6); the
	victim can resist with Stamina + Athletics (diff 6).  Each success
	on the mutant's part (over and above the successes of the victim)
	represents one point of Strength or Stamina that the mutant can
	absorb; he can absorb a total of one point each per turn.
	¥¥ The mutant can absorb up to two points each of Stamina and
	Strength per turn.
	¥¥¥ Up to three points each
	¥¥¥¥ Up to four points each
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to five points each
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ In addition to physical stats, the mutant can steal one action
	from the victim, allowing the mutant to act twice in one round.  If
	this action is the only one that the victim is eligible for, she will
	be stunned for that round.  This can be resisted with a Willpower
	check.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Two actions; the victim will be stunned for up to two rounds. 
	The mutant cannot steal more energy from her until the inactive
	period is up.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Three actions and up to three rounds.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant can 'deep draw' with the expenditure of a point
	of Willpower.  This allows the mutant to bring victims below one
	point in their physical attributes, either to zero (incapacity) or
	to "steal" a point of Mega-attribute.  Up to six points each.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to seven points each.

Aisle of Faery (Social) [AN]
	Oddly, the mutant functions as a walking magical/chimerical nexus,
	serving almost the same purpose as a ley line for magicians and
	supernatural forces of all sorts.  The Gauntlet and Banality of the
	surrounding area is lowered, magical abilities are augmented, and
	almost anything seems possible with the mutant around.  The mutant
	smells strongly of the Wyld to werewolves, who will tend to respond
	favourably to her.  No roll is required.
	
	Note that enemies or strangers in the area of effect will also gain
	the benefits of the Aisle.
	
	¥ The mutant's aisle of effect extends ten feet to the front and rear
	of her, and is six feet across.  The Gauntlet and Banality of the area
	is lowered by one.  All magical or spiritual abilities (including True
	Magick, Hedge Magic, Thaumaturgy, Gnosis, Glamour, and any Power with
	the words 'Magic', 'Spirit', or 'Dream' in its name) get one bonus die
	to the appropriate pools.
	¥¥ All Arcanoi that interact with the physical world enjoy a -1
	reduction in difficulty.  Two bonus dice.
	¥¥¥ The Gauntlet and Banality of an area are reduced by two.  The
	mutant's aisle acts as holy ground for immortals.  The aisle doubles
	in length and width.  Three bonus dice.  All Arts enjoy a -1 reduction
	in difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥ Four bonus dice to appropriate pools.  All True Magick performed
	in the Aisle is considered coincidental.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five bonus dice to appropriate pools.  The aisle doubles again
	in length and width.  The Gauntlet and Banality of an area are reduced
	by three, and all Arts and physical-world Arcanoi enjoy a -2 reduction
	in difficulty.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six bonus dice.  The aisle doubles again in length and width.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Six bonus dice and one automatic 'six' (if this is a success,
	count it as such).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Six bonus dice and two automatic 'sixes'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Six bonus dice and two automatic 'sevens'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Six bonus dice and three automatic 'sevens'.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Enchantment- any person intersecting the Aisle is automatically
	Enchanted (Willpower save to resist, if desired-- Dauntain resist
	automatically) for one hour per Rank.
	¥¥¥¥ No Banality- apart from the use of Arts that force a changeling 
	to accumulate banality, other sources (such as botches, or the
	presence of Dauntain) will not affect a changeling in the Aisle.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Bedlam- the mutant can attempt to inflict Bedlam on a changeling
	or enchanted mortal-- this will create level one Bedlam in a sane
	person, or advance a pre-existing level one state of Bedlam to level
	two.  It has no effect on someone that is already in Bedlam of level
	two or three.  The mutant spends a point of Power Charge and engages in
	a contested Willpower check with his opponent.  The difficulty for the
	mutant is 6; the difficulty for the changeling or enchanted mortal is
	6, modified by the difference between her Glamour and Willpower.  A
	higher Willpower decreases the changeling's difficulty; a higher
	Glamour increases it.  The mutant must beat the changeling by at least
	two successes to inflict Bedlam.
	
Alter Ego (Physical/Social/Mental) [PH]
	This is a very difficult power to play properly.  Make sure you are
	ready for the challenge before you take it up, because it can be messy.
	This ability comes in two varieties, and is a dual-edged sword in
	both of the forms.  The original Incredible Hulk had a physical alter ego.
	The second form is a purely mental or social power- no physical change
	takes place.  In both situations, the character suffers from multiple
	personalities.  These personalities may have different Powers and
	may be hostile to each other, etc.  Legion had this form of Alter Ego.
	While this Power may not seem very useful, it actually allows the
	mutant to lead a virtually normal, undetected life (if one of the
	egos is normal-looking).  It can also allow the mutant to have more
	Powers than the average.  For every point in Alter Ego above one,
	the mutant either has an extra personality or an extra Power.  That is,
	at level one, the mutant has two alter egos.  At level two, he either
	has three alter egos or two egos and an extra power- and so on.  Typhoid
	Mary also has this power.
	
	¥ Mutant has an Alter Ego- two personalities and possibly two physical
	forms.
	¥¥ Up to three personalities or one extra power.
	¥¥¥ Up to four personalities or two extra powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to five personalities or three extra powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to six personalities or four extra powers.
	
	These can be mixed and matched.  A mutant with ¥¥¥¥ Alter Ego might
	have three personalities and two extra powers or two personalities
	and three extra powers, or four personalities and one extra power.
	
	* To create a physical character with this power, simply design
	a separate character (in Attributes 7/5/3, Abilities 10/7/4, in
	Backgrounds split 5 points between all of the personalities and
	9 freebies for each) for each alter ego.  They will have at least one
	common power (Alter Ego) but aside from that, they may have separate
	powers.  Split the standard six ranks (aside from the ranks you spent
	on Alter Ego) of Power among them as you like.  Then split any extra
	Ranks that you may get with this power as you like, as well.  Note
	that you must separately determine the Power Potential and Actual
	Power Level of each ego, and in THIS CASE AND THIS CASE ONLY, you
	may reduce the APL for freebie points to below the level of this 
	power on one or more personalities if you want them to be powerless-
	that is, those personalities can have no Powers or Power Stunts
	other than Alter Ego, and these 'stunted' personalities will never
	be able to increase their Power Potential or APL.
	* To create a mental character with this power, do the same as 
	above, only leave the Physical stats where they are (if you spent
	seven points on that category, then you have 5/3 to spend on Social
	and Mental).
	* Experience may be split among the personalities however you like,
	with Storyteller approval.  Only one Ego need bump up the Alter Ego
	Power for all of the other personalities to enjoy a similar increase,
	but this is not the case with any other powers that might be shared
	incidentally (two personalities happen to have Fire Emission, for 
	instance- bought separately at character creation, of course.  One
	could increase the level of the Power or buy a new Power Stunt, and
	the other would not enjoy the same benefit).
	* Buying a new level of Alter Ego with experience points rather
	than freebie points creates a new personality AND a new power for
	that personality.  This new personality should be created with the
	system described above, and the new power will be rank one.  This
	new personality can only have Abilities that the other personalities
	already have when first created, and it can't have backgrounds or
	Power Stunts.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Scent state- The mutant must have the Physical form of this power.
	She does not have the same scent in her different forms, and can
	throw off trackers in this way by shifting egos.  This Stunt needs
	only be bought once.
	¥ Control change of state- Normally, Alter Ego shifts are involuntary.
	This Power Stunt allows a mutant to change voluntarily from one form
	to another.  This Stunt must be bought separately for each possible
	change! Mary might buy this Stunt to change into Typhoid Mary on
	purpose, but in order for Typhoid to do the same, the Stunt would have
	to be bought for her, too!  This wouldn't allow Mary to change at will
	into Bloody Mary, either- another Stunt would have to be bought for that.
	¥¥ Fire in the Head- one Alter Ego can attempt to try to influence
	the behavior of another (this can get really complex...) by using this
	Power Stunt.  It must be bought separately for each Ego if you want all
	of them to have it.  Contested Willpower checks can be used to keep
	the dominant personality from performing a certain action.
	¥¥ The Hint- Like Fire in the Head, this power allows one Alter Ego
	to whisper instructions or hints to another.  This can help in situations
	where the dominant personality lacks a vital piece of info.  This must
	be bought separately for each Ego.
	¥¥ Telepathic resistance- each point of Alter Ego serves as one point
	of automatic soak or anti-magic or resistance against any attempt to
	dominate or psychically attack a character with this Power Stunt.
	Does not include the Blood Bond.
	¥¥ Back of the Line- Requires Fire in the Head.  An Ego with this
	power stunt can attempt to shunt the dominant personality out of the
	way and take over- a resisted Willpower roll, difficulty 6.
	¥¥ Sleep of Ages- An Ego with this Power Stunt (it must be bought for
	each one that wants it) can try to put a passive personality to
	sleep when it is dominant.  This allows the Ego to do things that it
	does not want the other personality to be aware of.  Requires three
	accumulated successes on the resisted Willpower roll (diff of the
	opposing willpower + 3).
	¥¥¥ Break TP Link- Requires Back of the Line.  An Ego can try to break
	a telepathic link of any kind by forcing the dominant personality to
	the Back of the Line.  This works at the Storyteller's discretion.

Alter Senses (Mental) [AH]
	This Power allows the mutant to change how another person's senses
	operate.  He can do such things as induce blindness (or have all
	visual data be interpreted by the brain as sounds) or make every
	noise that the person hears seem to boom, or even make everything
	taste like banana pudding.  Inducing hallucinations is even possible
	at higher ranks.  The system for this is Perception + Alter Senses;
	the difficulty is typically 6.  Disorientation and blindness, etc.
	can increase the target's difficulties by one or more.  Note that
	all of these changes last up to one scene, and are not cumulative (a
	mutant could not be affected by the Power at Rank one five times in 
	one scene to produce strangeness in all five senses).
	
	Note that the mutant can, in conjunction with any Altered Perceptions
	Powers that he might have, create equivalent Altered Perceptions in
	other people using this Power.

	¥ The mutant can affect one sense at a time (but cannot induce
	hallucinations).
	¥¥ Two senses can be affected.
	¥¥¥ Three sense can be affected; the mutant can create hallucinations
	in one of these.
	¥¥¥¥ Four senses can be affected, including Intuition, Combat Sense,
	Danger Sense, and other 'senses'.  Hallucinations can be created in
	two of these.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five senses can be affected, including hallucinations.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can affect six senses, if he himself has six.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Patch Cable- the mutant may 'exchange' the sensory experiences
	of two subjects (including himself, if desired)- affecting a
	number of senses equal to half his Rank.

Altered Perceptions (Physical/Social/Mental) [PN]
	The mutant sees or hears things that few others can hear, because his
	ability to perceive things has been expanded in some way.  There are
	any number of possible variations on this power, and a number of
	possible correlative senses for each variation.  Wolverine has
	Heightened Senses, while Magneto can hear radio waves without a
	receiver, and Shaman of Alpha Flight has the ability to perceive
	spiritual energy.  The Mechanist's Sight power is related to this
	ability but treated separately, as are powers such as Aura Sight
	and Clairvoyance.  Most of the time, no roll is required other
	that Perception + Alertness.

	¥ Detect energy by vision or sensation (one type like electricity)
	¥ High frequency audition- you can hear sounds at a much higher
	frequency than normal humans can- you can hear dog whistles!
	¥ Infrared vision
	¥ Low frequency audition- you can hear sounds at a much lower
	frequency than normal humans can.
	¥ Microwave vision (heat imaging)
	¥ Protected senses- like the Banshee, who can get sensory overload to
	your eardrums with no loss of sensitivity, one of your sensory organs
	is protected from extreme input.  Someone with protected vision cannot
	be blinded by bright light or radiation, but can not see if there is no
	light, or if his eyes are poked out.  For extra Ranks, you can protect
	the other sensory organs (two ranks might protect hearing and smell,
	for example).
	¥ Low-light vision
	¥ See Auras [AN].  With practice, the mutant can distinguish a vampire
	from a normal human, and an angry man from a merely aggressive one
	by interpreting this information.  Takes an action to activate and
	shut off.
	¥ X-Ray vision- you can see x-rays (not too useful unless you
	take Energy Emission [X-Rays]).
	¥¥ Fast Refresh- your mutant's visual field is updated much more often
	than a normal human's, and your retinal memory does not interfere with
	this.  While watching TV becomes impossible, you can see a lot of stuff
	that others don't (bullets in flight, hyper-speed characters) and get
	an extra die to dodge these things.
	¥¥ Filtering Vision [PL]- the mutant can 'refuse' to see one certain
	substance at a time- choosing to filter out water to see the ocean
	floor, for instance.
	Special variation: Heavy Filters [PL]- the mutant, instead of seeing
	all substances but one, sees no substances but one.
	¥¥ Lightless Vision- the mutant does not require electromagnetic
	radiation of any kind in order to see.
	¥¥ Microscopic Vision- you can alter your vision to see items as small
	as viruses and the surfaces of atoms, at will.
	¥¥ Osmosis (Mental) [AL]- This is a power of information assimilation
	through touch.  Whenever the mutant touches an object containing
	information (written word, pictures or similar 'hard copy') he/she can
	make a mental 'copy' of it.  Whether the mutant can understand it or
	not is dependant on the mutant's knowledge of language or whatever
	ability is needed to make any sense of it.  For four extra freebie or
	Experience points, he may absorb encoded info from digital media such
	as CDs.
	¥¥ Sensitive touch- you can feel the shapes of things much more
	keenly than others.  Daredevil can read print with his fingertips.
	the Fine Control ability costs half as much.
	¥¥ Sonar- you can interpret the shapes of things by the way sound
	bounces off of them.  Requires Heightened Senses (Hearing).
	¥¥ Spirit sight (by vision, usually, though another sense or a
	vague 'feeling' would be just as good)- perceive stuff from across
	the Gauntlet.
	¥¥ Synesthesia- one of your senses can be experienced via another set
	of organs (select at character creation)-- experience sound visually,
	or smells aurally.  Each additional sense that can be "co-experienced"
	in this way adds one Rank to this Power.  Subtract one from all 
	Perception difficulties regarding any "co-experienced" stimulus.
	¥¥ Telescopic Vision- not quite the same as Clairvoyance, since you
	need a clear line-of-sight, but it is powerful enough to see details
	as small as a footprint on the surface of the moon, for instance.
	¥¥ 360 Degree Vision- the mutant has got sense organs that give her
	vision in a full 360 degrees of arc, and the brain modifications
	necessary to process the data.
	¥¥¥ Discrimination- (one dot each for hearing, smell, taste)- You can
	distinguish several stimuli that are co-occurring with each other,
	and concentrate on a single one, if desired.
	¥¥¥ Environmental Awareness- the mutant can detect changes in humidity,
	temperature, air pressure, chemical concentrations, movement, and life
	force anywhere within 30 feet.
	¥¥¥ Heightened Senses (one dot each for vision, hearing, smell)-  All
	Perception difficulties for you are two lower in each of the senses
	that is heightened.  Some spectacular feats are possible when this is
	combined with Discrimination.
	¥¥¥ Material Sense- the mutant can detect the chemical constituents
	and behavior of the matter within 30 feet of her.  Thus, she can
	detect the mass of any object, its chemical composition, temperature,
	rate of movement (roughly), and how it is reacting chemically to its
	surroundings.
	¥¥¥ Organless Senses- the mutant can see, hear, smell, and taste 
	through any exposed part of her body, with light concentration.
	¥¥¥ Penetrating Vision [AL]- as with Filtering Vision, except the mutant
	can see through any substance or combination of substances as an act
	of will, to normal visual range (each time the mutant encounters a
	visual barrier, he may elect to see through it).
	¥¥¥ Spatial Sense- like Daredevil, you can feel the shapes of things
	around you.  Useful in the dark or when blind.  The Blindfighting skill
	costs only one point per dot, even with Experience, and you cannot be
	stabbed in the back with surprise if you are awake.  If you have an
	action left, you can Dodge rear attacks, etc.
	¥¥¥ True Sight- the mutant automatically sees through disguises,
	illusions, invisibility of all sorts, plastic surgery, or shape-
	shifting to see the 'true' shape of an object.  The apparent shape
	is visible as a dim outline.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Cosmic Awareness [AL]- the mutant has all of the Altered
	Perceptions Powers on this list, and any Detection Power to the range
	of anywhere in the universe.  She may have any or all of these powers
	at once, but the brain is a fragile thing, and it can only handle as
	many Ranks of input as she has Wits x 2.  Attempting to overcome this
	limitation will result in a psychic backlash (loss of a point of Power
	Charge).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Osmosis Sight (Osmosis Stunt)- requires an appropriate level of
	Attunement.  The mutant can attune to an object and use its surface
	(or interior) to 'see' in the immediate area (one metre per point in
	Perception).  The input manifests as colour images, not particularly
	sharp, and will function in lightless conditions.
	¥¥¥ Blind Reading (Discrimination Stunt)- you may read a newspaper or
	other print document by touch (distinguishing the 'feel' of the type
	from the rest of the page).
	¥¥¥ Hyper Tracking (Heightened Senses Stunt)- The mutant may purchase
	the Power: Hyper-Ability (Tracking) with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Perceptive (Heightened Senses Stunt)- you may increase your
	Perception score past five with Experience points.
	¥¥¥ Recognition (Heightened Senses Stunt)- you can recognize a person
	by scent with a Perception + Area Knowledge roll (diff varies with how
	well you know the person).
	¥¥¥ Struck Blind (Heightened Senses Stunt)- The mutant's Blindfighting
	difficulty is the same as her Brawl or Martial Arts difficulty.

Anatomical Grafting (Physical) [AL]
	This Power is absolutely disgusting, but here goes.  Like Terror
	of Terror, Inc., your mutant has the ability to detach his body
	parts and replace them with new ones from dead bodies.  Yuck.
	These bodies must be carbon-based life forms, etc. and must have
	been recently alive (no vampires).  In essence, this Power allows
	the mutant to get new physical attributes by stealing body parts.
	A metis werewolf's arm, for instance, might grant a Strength of
	seven in that arm.  This requires a little bit of bookkeeping,
	since different parts will have different attributes.  Sometimes
	this can allow for some neat effects- the Hulk's arm would be
	pretty damage resistant, for instance...  A one-time Stamina
	check (difficulty 8) is required to graft the limb for the
	first time.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant may graft on any part that he can get to fit and
	function.  Yuck.

Anatomical Separation (Physical) [AL]
	OK, this Power is pretty gross.  Like Terror of Terror, Inc. and
	Elsie-Dee the android, your mutant has the ability to detach parts of
	his body and have them continue to function by calling out simple
	commands ("Come here", "Attack that guy!", "A little more to the left!"
	This allows multiple attacks, etc.  Arms can't fly, but can pull
	themselves along the ground... fingers crawl along like inchworms,
	heads roll, etc.  For every part that is separated from the host,
	all parts lose one die from their dice pools.  Each part gets its
	own action every turn.  If the mutant attempts to separate more
	parts than he has Ranks, then he loses control of all of his parts,
	and must reassert control one-by-one over his normal maximum of
	mobile parts.
	
	Special Flaw: One-Trick Pony (1-point Flaw)- each point in this
	Power represents a single part that can be separated- that is, a
	mutant with this Flaw and one Rank in this Power might only be able
	to separate his left hand, for instance, rather than electing to
	detach some other part.  At Rank two, he might be able to separate
	only his left hand and his right eye.  Garrison Kane of Weapon X has
	this Flaw.
	
	¥ One part can be separated
	¥¥ Two parts
	¥¥¥ Three parts
	¥¥¥¥ Four parts
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five parts
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six parts
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven parts
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight parts
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine parts
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten parts

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Life Support- you may purchase the Power: Life Support with
	Experience.
	¥¥ Cutting Dodge- the mutant takes an action preparing to make a
	separation, and rolls Stamina + Anatomical Separation.  Any cutting 
	or edged attack on the mutant initiates a separation.  The mutant's
	successes are subtracted both from the enemy's roll to hit and the
	damage roll.
	¥¥ Unique Physiology- you may purchase the Power: Unique Physiology
	with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Remote control- non-verbal commands, you control the part as you
	normally would and you feel what it feels.  Dice pool splitting may
	be necessary in many cases.
	¥¥¥ Stepped out- the mutant can remove seemingly vital parts (such as
	the heart or brain) with no ill effects.  Such organs perform their
	functions for the body even over great distances (perhaps through 
	some sort of spatial warp).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Canopic Jar- requires the Stunt: Stepped out.  You may store a
	vital part (such as a heart, brain, or kidney) separately for an
	indefinite period.  This does not require concentration.  Note that
	the mutant cannot die from lethal damage if the heart and brain are
	not present; aggravated damage will still do the trick.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Self-Contained- requires the Stunts: Life Support and Canopic
	Jar.  You may purchase the Power: Decentralized Identity with
	Experience.

Ancestral Memory (Mental) [PN]
	One of the rare Powers that always comes at the time of birth,
	Ancestral Memory will probably make the mutant's teachers think that
	he or she is a developmental genius.  This is true, in a way.  The
	mutant is born with the memories of all of his ancestors up to the
	time of his birth.  This Power is always hereditary.  If the mutant is
	the first to have this Power, then he remembers everything from his
	father's life up to the time that the mutant himself was born, and
	everything from the lives of the prior generations.  This memory
	always passes along sex lines (father to son, mother to daughter).  If
	the mutant is the third (or fourth, or what have you), then he only
	has the memories of his progenitors to the point in their lives when
	the next same-sex descendant in line was born. (So, the mutant would
	have his granddad's memories up to the point when his dad was born, not
	when his dad's older brother was born.  He gets more memories from his
	granddad than the male sons of his uncle.  He gets memories from his
	dad up until the point that he was born.  If his granddad was the first
	to have the power, then he has all the memories of his great-granddad,
	and so on back through the ages).  Note that if his granddad is still
	alive when he is born (even if he is the first to have this power),
	then he only gets his granddad's memories up to the point when he
	himself is born, just as with his father.  No roll is required to
	use this Power (except maybe an Intelligence check of some kind to
	remember a particular detail).
	
	¥¥ The mutant gets 15/15/15 for Abilities instead of 13/9/5.  Favour
	should be given to some archaic skills like tracking, history, etc.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Hunter-Gatherer- the mutant can improve Survival at a cost of 
	1 x current, and gets two automatic successes.

Animal Telepathy (Mental) [AH]
	This is the ability to connect your mind with those of animals, either
	to chat or to command.  Moonstar of the New Mutants and the Vulture both
	displayed variations of this power.  It is otherwise undistinguishable
	from normal Telepathy, save that humans cannot be contacted with it
	(whereas normal TP cannot reach the minds of animals).  An animal TPath
	can always contact a werewolf, even when he is in 'homid' form.  The
	basic roll is Perception + Telepathy to detect, Manipulation + Telepathy
	to actively manipulate, Intelligence + Telepathy to attack, or Charisma
	+ Telepathy to convince.
	
	Special Flaw: One Voice (1-3 points)- the mutant can only contact one
	type of animal, be it mammals, birds, fish, or reptiles (one point) or
	perhaps canines, felines, raptors, or snakes (two points), or even as
	specific as wolves, cougars, hawks, or rattlers (three points).  The
	Vulture can only communicate with birds.

	¥ Detect animals, mental conversation, read emotional impressions,
	shield mind
	¥¥ Detect telepaths and other unusual minds (like insane folks, or mages)
	Read surface thoughts
	¥¥¥ Deliver imperatives (Manipulation + Telepathy, Willpower to resist)-
	requires a separate roll for each command, Read memories, induce
	emotional state (same system)- can cause a Garou to frenzy
	¥¥¥¥ Alter perceptions, implant memories, cause derangement, dominate
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral form, prevent power use, mental blocks, mental assault
	(can actually cause physical damage!)
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Detect wraiths, spirits, and astral travelers (Per + Awareness)
	¥¥ Multitasking- you can perform a physical action as well as a mental
	one at +2 difficulty to each.  Higher than ten difficulty means that
	it is impossible to perform that action.
	¥¥ ESP- you can buy the power Mega-Perception (ESP) with Experience
	points, even if you did not start with it.
	¥¥¥ Subtle implant- you can make it seem (Manipulation + Subterfuge) as
	though an imperative that you implant actually originated in the 
	target's mind.  Difficulty of the victim's Int + Subterfuge.
	¥¥¥ Understand language- use the knowledge from an animal's head to
	carry on a conversation in a language that you don't know (like
	dolphin- don't try this with porcupines)!
	¥¥¥¥ Invisibility- you don't notice me!  The difficulty is the target's
	Perception + Intuition or Perception + Awareness.
	¥¥¥¥ Mental Blocks- you can erect a block (roll Telepathy, count the
	successes) in a target's mind to keep it from performing a certain
	action.  If the target attempts to perform the action anyway, he
	requires as many successes on a Willpower check as you got successes
	to erect the block.  Destroying the block in this way takes an action.
	¥¥¥¥ Primal mind- you can affect a normal person by playing with the
	primitive parts of the brain that you're used to talking to in animals.
	There are any number of nasty things you can do to someone by playing
	with his ganglia.
	¥¥¥¥ Sensory overload- force a sense to shut down temporarily.  No
	permanent damage.  Difficulty of the target's Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥ Astral travel- surf the Astral Plane.  Weird and wonderful.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral possession- better than dominate.  You can skinride like
	a wraith and take over a body.  Requires Astral travel.  Once inside
	the host, a battle of wills takes place- each round, the two contest
	each other in a Willpower check (diff 4).  The victor drains one
	point from the loser's supply of Temporary Willpower.  When one or
	the other is reduced to zero Willpower, hegemony over the body is
	determined.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Astral survival- live through the destruction of your body!
	Good luck getting another one, though...  Requires Astral travel.

Apportation (Social) [AH]
	This is the ability to teleport objects from anywhere in the mutant's
	range to anywhere else in range.  The mutant need not have line of
	sight with the object.  This is a useful means of summoning things
	to hand.  Though she did not use this Power to do so, Magik often
	apported her Soulsword.  Roll Dexterity + Apportation (diff 7).
	
	¥ Range of five meters and 20 pounds
	¥¥ Five miles and 50 pounds
	¥¥¥ Five hundred miles and 500 pounds
	¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on Earth and 5 tons
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere you've been (in this dimension) and 500 tons
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere you know very well in another dimension and 5 kilotons.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere you've been in another dimension and 50 kilotons.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Anywhere you've seen in another dimension and 500 kilotons.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Anytime you remember vividly and 5 megatons.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Anytime you've been and 50 megatons.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Come to me- the mutant can apport living, willing subjects in
	the same way that objects are handled.

Assimilation (Physical) [AL]
	This is a strange mutation that will end in the character looking more
	like a cyborg than a mutant; it allows him to actually absorb
	technological devices into his body and interface them with his
	nervous system.  Naturally, there is a limit to the volume, matter,
	and power requirements for such devices that limits the mutant's
	ability to assimilate them.  These devices do not have to be visible
	all the time, but can be hidden inside the mutant's body. When the
	mutant needs an assimilated device, it comes forward to protrude from
	hands, feet, chest, etc.  The mutant may also (at any time) release a
	device from his body (returning it to its original state as he does
	so).

	Note that while a device is part of a mutant's body, he need not pull
	triggers or press buttons; these functions are now connected to the
	character's nervous system.  The roll to assimilate or reject an item
	is Stamina + Assimilation.

	¥ A total number of items that weigh (at most) up to two pounds 
	can be assimilated, and these must be self-powered.
	¥¥ Items weighing up to five pounds may be assimilated.  Normal
	current (such as that obtainable from a wall socket) can be
	supplied by the mutant's nervous system.
	¥¥¥ Items with a total weight of up to ten pounds may be absorbed,
	with current equal to that from Energy Emission at Rank one being
	available.
	¥¥¥¥ Items with a total weight of up to twenty pounds may be
	absorbed, and electricity of a potency equivalent to Energy Emission
	at Rank two is available.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Items with a total weight of up to fifty pounds may be
	assimilated, with electricity equivalent to EE at Rank 3.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Items with a total weight of one hundred pounds may be
	assimilated, with electricity equivalent to EE at Rank 5.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Items that are the same weight as the mutant or less may
	be assimilated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Items that are twice the weight of the mutant may be
	assimilated (these may be larger than the mutant; obviously, such
	objects cannot be hidden, and the mutant may resemble a graft onto the
	object rather than the reverse).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Items that are four times the weight of the mutant may be
	assimilated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Items that are ten times the weight of the mutant may be
	assimilated.

Attribute Shift (Physical/Social/Mental) [AN]
	This strange Power allows a mutant to shift her Attributes within a
	particular category (Physical, Social, or Mental) as the situation
	seems to demand.  Does the character need to be stronger?  Her high
	Dexterity score can be traded for her lower Strength score.  Is an
	anvil about to fall on her head?  Shift your best physical Attribute
	score to Dexterity (to dodge it) or Stamina (to soak the damage) as you
	see fit.  The Social and Mental versions of this Power work in the same
	way-- in essence, one category has a 'default' setting, but the mutant
	may shift the Attributes within it around once a round, as a free
	action.
	
	Note that some Powers that affect Attributes (such as Matter Body, or
	Physical Transformation) apply their bonuses after Attribute Shifting
	is applied
	
	Variation: Full Spectrum Shift* [AN]- as above, but the mutant has 
	control over all three attribute categories.  However, attributes may
	still only be exchanged within their own categories-- Strength cannot
	be exchanged for Wits, for example.
	
	¥ The mutant can exchange Attributes within one point of each other.
	Mega-Attributes cannot be shifted.
	¥¥ Exchange Attributes within normal human limits (a Strength of one
	and a Dexterity of 5 can have their scores exchanged).
	¥¥¥ Exchange the scores of Attributes that exceed normal human limits
	(a Strength of 7 and a Dexterity of 4, for example) so long as neither
	score reflects a Mega-Attribute.
	¥¥¥¥ Exchange Mega-Attributes temporarily-- the mutant may develop
	Stunts for the new Mega-Attribute that can be accessed whenever it is
	available (eg, the mutant may use Agitation whenever he has
	Mega-Charisma, but not when the Mega-Attribute Power is assigned to a
	different Attribute).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's Attributes can be 'partially' redistributed.  For
	example, he can transfer one point of Perception to Intelligence,
	rather than exchanging the scores.  Record the total number of dots the
	mutant has in the category-- these can be reassigned once a round, if
	desired.  However, the mutant must always have at least one point in
	each Attribute.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Solid State- the mutant no longer has a 'default' state-- all
	Attribute shifts are considered permanent.
	¥¥¥ Reflective Boost- so long as the mutant has one score in the
	category that is higher than five, she may increase all of them above
	five with Experience points (even if the boosted Attribute reflects a
	Mega-Attribute).
	
Attribute Vampirism (Physical) [AL]
	This Power has an empathic tint to it, but is not entirely empathic.
	In essence, the mutant touches his intended victim, and his body begins
	to manufacture a customized pheromone that will induce a euphoric state
	in the victim.  The result is subtler than it sounds, and will generally
	induce feelings of love and loyalty- frequently, strong sexual attraction.
	This is only part of the story.  The other part is the fact that the
	mutant slowly drains away the Attributes of his victim, and exchanges
	them for his own.  Any attribute of the victim's that is superior to
	that of the mutant will slowly drain away until it is reduced to a level
	equal to that of the mutant.  The mutant's attribute will increase in
	like manner.  This requires a long period of time (thus the empathic
	effect), but the effects will ultimately become permanent if the contact
	is not severed.  In order to establish the link, the mutant must roll
	Appearance + Attribute Vampirism (diff of the victim's Willpower; if the
	victim has a spouse, the difficulty is increased by three).
	
	¥ The mutant drains Attributes at a rate of one point per week.  The
	first ones to go are Strength, Stamina, Appearance, and Dexterity.
	Next, Perception, Wits, and Intelligence.  Finally, Charisma and
	Manipulation.  Once no attribute remains in which the victim is
	superior to the mutant, a 'hardening' process takes place.  After a
	month of this process, the Attribute levels become permanent, and the
	mutant can leave.  The mutant can only affect one person at a time in
	this way.  If contact is broken before the 'hardening' is finished,
	the victim regains her Attributes at the rate of one per day.  Here,
	contact means spending at least six hours a day together, and no more
	than one day apart.  The mutant can re-establish contact at any time
	if it has been broken, but if the victim has been apprised of the
	situation, it may be difficult to maintain it.  Naturally, even though
	the mutant can spend a day apart from his victim, the day that was
	missed does not count towards the seven days required to drain an
	Attribute.
	¥¥ The mutant drains Attributes at a rate of two points per week.
	The hardening process takes three weeks.
	¥¥¥ The mutant drains Attributes at a rate of three points per week.
	The hardening process takes two weeks.  The mutant can spend as much
	as two days apart without breaking contact.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant drains Attributes at a rate of a point every two
	days.  The hardening process takes ten days.  The mutant can spend
	as much as three days apart without breaking contact.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant drains Attributes at a rate of one point every
	day.  The hardening process takes a week.  The mutant can spend as
	much as a week apart without breaking contact.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant drains attributes at a rate of one point every
	six hours.  The hardening process takes three days.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant drains attributes at a rate of one point every
	three hours.  The hardening process takes two days.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant drains attributes at a rate of one point every
	two hours.  The hardening process takes a day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant drains attributes at a rate of one point per
	hour.  The hardening process takes a day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant drains attributes at a rate of two points per
	hour.  The hardening process takes a day.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Disease- the mutant may 'transfer' a disease or other affliction
	to his victim, effectively curing himself of it.  This takes as long
	as the hardening process.
	¥¥¥¥ Health- the mutant may also drain Health Levels to replenish
	his own lost levels.  He may not gain extra Health Levels in this
	way.

Audiokinesis (Mental) [AH]
	You have special power to create and still vibrations with your mind
	if you have audiokinesis, but your range of action is specifically
	related to audible vibrations.  It requires considerable concentration,
	but you need no attack roll-- sound is created anywhere within your
	range of hearing.  Speech is possible without opening your mouth, and
	a powerful and creative mutant could even simulate an enormous rock
	concert.  Requires an Intelligence + Audiokinesis (difficulty is
	usually 6).
	
	¥ Two points of sound damage may be created, dampened, or redirected.
	¥¥ Three points.
	¥¥¥ Four points.
	¥¥¥¥ Five points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Six Health Levels.
	
	If the mutant loses her concentration, the effect vanishes (the sound
	fades away, resumes its regular volume, or moves in its regular
	direction) and she must begin again.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Mimicry- make a Perception + Expression roll (difficulty varies
	with how well you know the target-- six for a casual friend) to study
	the voice of a person.  For the rest of the scene, you can mimic his
	voice (Manipulation + Audiokinesis).  The number of successes on the
	first roll determines the quality of the mimicry.

Aura Control (Social) [AL]
	An unusual power, Aura Control allows a mutant to tinker with the
	energy signatures that are given off by all living things.  At low
	Ranks, the mutant may only perceive auras, or alter her own, but her
	mastery increases with experience.  The Kirlian Man (of Astro City) has
	this Power.  Perceiving auras usually requires a Perception + Aura
	Control roll (diff. 4), while active control of auras uses Manipulation
	+ Aura Control (difficulty varies-- see below).  All the uses of this
	Power are temporary, lasting as long as the mutant maintains light
	concentration.
	
	¥ The mutant may perceive auras, including her own, with light
	concentration (Perception + Aura Control, diff. 4).  With practice, she
	will be able to distinguish humans from mutants from vampires.
	¥¥ The mutant may manipulate the appearance of her own aura, fooling
	those who are capable of perceiving them into thinking that she is 
	something else (a normal human, vampire, lycanthrope, etc.).  This 
	requires a Manipulation + Aura Control roll, difficulty equal to her
	Power Charge.
	¥¥¥ The mutant may make deeper changes to her own aura, which may allow
	her to escape detection by certain exclusive effects (for example, a
	character with mutant detection would not be able to perceive her as
	one) or allow inclusion by similarly exclusive effects (a healing art
	that only worked on changelings, for example, would work on her).  Note
	that this change _does not_ make the mutant into something else, or
	allow her to learn exclusive abilities such as gifts or disciplines.
	The difficulty of this roll is the mutant's Power Charge + 1.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant may affect the auras of others as Rank two.  The mutant
	must touch the target to initiate the change, which has standard 
	difficulty (the target's Power Charge).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant may affect the auras of others as Rank three; she may
	also affect any Power (hers or another's) that is aura-based.  This
	includes Altered Perceptions (See Auras), Aura of Decay, Diabolic Aura,
	Horror Factor, and any Power that specifically mentions or utilizes
	auras (such as Synch's ability to mimic mutant powers).  The mutant may
	utilize any of the effects of Power Amplification, Power Dampening, or
	even Power Puppetry against _aura abilities only_.  These effects
	function at two Ranks lower than the mutant's Rank in Aura Control, and
	function at a difficulty equal to the target's Power Charge + 1.  If
	the target is not a mutant (for example, the mutant is attempting to
	interfere with a vampire's use of Auspex), the difficulty is equal to
	the target's controlling ability (rank in Auspex, current Gnosis, etc.)
	+ 3.  As with Rank four, making these changes requires that the mutant
	touch the target.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant may create an aura around an object that would not
	normally have one (anything that is not magical, not alive, etc.), 
	which can allow it to be affected by exclusive effects, as per Rank 
	two, or protect it from exclusive effects.  The difficulty for this
	is six (for an object that is human-sized or less), modified upward for
	larger objects as the ST sees fit (a small building should be at least 
	9).  Note that auras can only be granted to discreet objects-- you
	can't give an aura to half of a car, for example.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Aura Mimicry- the mutant may mimic any aura-related Powers
	that she can perceive (as if she had Power Mimicry) and maintain them
	with light concentration.  The difficulty is the target's Power Charge
	+ 1, or governing ability + 3.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ See Auras- the mutant may purchase the Power: Altered Perceptions
	(See Auras) with Experience.  This obviates the need to concentrate to
	perceive auras.
	¥¥ High Fidelity- the mutant's ability to perceive auras is very fine;
	she may perceive the differences between the auras of two people of
	the same 'type' (two mutants, for example), and isolate the differences
	using Intelligence + Power Lore, Intelligence + Garou Lore, or whatever
	knowledge seems appropriate.  To make a detailed study of another
	person's aura requires a Perception + Fine Control roll (difficulty
	base 6, increases or decreases with familiarity with the subject).
	¥¥¥ Aura Duplication- requires the Stunt: High Fidelity.  The mutant
	may 'fool' devices that check auras to discern identity by exactly
	duplicating the aura of someone that she is very familiar with.  The
	difficulty of this roll (Manipulation + Aura Control) is equal to
	the mutant's Power Charge + 3.
	¥¥¥¥ Auto-Keying- the mutant may use a target's aura in exacting
	detail (duplicating it, if she has the stunt, or gaining a High
	Fidelity image, if she has that stunt) by touching the target.  No
	further roll is required.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Hedging- requires the stunt: Aura Duplication.  The mutant may
	prevent an enemy from touching her (or another target) by overlaying
	her aura with her enemy's aura.  Note that this will also prevent her
	from touching the enemy!
	¥¥¥¥¥ Power Hedging- requires the stunt: Hedging.  Any Powers such as
	Energy Emission or Hedge Magick that the target might have (that use
	energy of some kind or involve direct interaction, like Telepathy) are
	also hedged, as the Hedging stunt.  Note that some Powers can get 
	around this (there's nothing stopping a hedged target from throwing a
	rock at the mutant using his TK, even if he can't affect her directly
	with it).
	
Aura of Decay (Social) [AL]
	This is a Power of death and destruction, erosion and decay.  It does
	not affect living matter, but affects non-living matter, organic or
	inorganic.  These objects will crumble, thin, or shrivel as appropriate
	to the matter of which they are composed, until very little remains.
	The aura extends one metre from the mutant's body.  Most objects will
	not receive any form of soak; special cases may allow a resistance roll
	of some kind.  Note that this Power cannot operate simultaneously with
	a Diabolic Aura.  The Storyteller has the final say on how many Health
	Levels a particular object might have.  Typically, the mutant's own
	possessions (at least, those that he is carrying) are exempt from the
	damaging effects of the Aura of Decay.
	
	Variation: Dark Touch- for four extra Experience or freebie points per
	Rank, the aura also affects living matter.  However, the damage dice
	are halved.
	
	Special Flaw: Decaying Possessions (2 pts.)- Your aura affects your own
	possessions; the Attunement background is not proof against this.
	
	Special Merit: Foul Contact (4 pts.)- if the Aura of Decay comes into
	contact with an object to which a mutant is attuned, that person will
	feel sharp pain while the object decays, suffering dice penalties in
	that round equal to one die per Health Level that the object loses.
	This pain lasts only for the round in which the object takes damage,
	but assuming the contact and damage is continuous, the victim will
	continue to suffer from dice penalties in varying amounts until the
	object is destroyed.
	
	¥ Two dice of damage per round on any object intersecting the mutant's
	foul aura.
	¥¥ Four damage dice.
	¥¥¥ Six dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten dice.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Discrimination- the mutant can choose a target that won't be
	affected.
	¥¥ Vision of Decay- the mutant can purchase the Power: Vision of Decay
	with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Entropic touch- the mutant can channel the effect of the aura into
	an object.  Only that specifically targeted object will take damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Nether- you may purchase Energy Sheath: Nether with Experience.
	¥¥¥¥ Tentacles- the mutant can concentrate the aura into tentacles.  The
	tentacle does not have any Strength or Stamina rating, only a Dexterity
	rating. The tentacle does not have Health Levels and can't take damage.
	The damage pool is split between the tentacles in any combination the
	mutant chooses.  A tentacle is two metres in length to begin with and
	must have at least one die of damage pool.  For every extra damage die,
	the Tentacle grows one metre in length.
	¥¥¥¥ Ray of oblivion - a beam or bolt of concentrated oblivion, 2 dice
	damage/rank.  Use Dex + Directed Blast.  If the mutant has the Dark
	Touch variation, this Stunt does full damage to human flesh and it is
	soaked with Charisma rather than Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Obliviating radiance- the mutant can spread the aura's effects
	into the surrounding area as if it were radiation.  The damage potential
	diminishes by one die for every two metres it expands, so the further
	away things are the slower they decay.  At a distance of nine metres the
	damage will have diminished by four dice.

Autumn Force** (Social) [AN]
	A mutant with this Power can possess no other.  Like Grey the Mundane
	of the Xanth novels (Hi Piers!), the mutant is an extremely potent
	Autumn Person- not in personality, but in his influence on reality.
	In the mutant's presence, no Magick, Gifts, Disciplines, Arcanoi,
	or Powers function.  Werewolves are forced into Homid or Lupus form.
	All Attributes in excess of 5 are 'cut back' to that level.  Vampires
	are not affected by sunlight, nor are werewolves especially
	susceptible to silver.  Spirits are instantly banished to the Umbra.
	The Gauntlet becomes uncrossable.  In short, normality surrounds the
	mutant like an impenetrable cloud.  Nothing within one mile of the
	mutant can be anomalous.  This Power is involuntary.  Note that it
	affects the mutant's OWN paranormal abilities as well!  Does not
	require a roll of any kind.
	
	¥¥¥ Your mutant is a force for normality in our time.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Autumn's Rot- the mutant is an exceptionally powerful Dauntain
	(see Changeling: the Dreaming) and adds one point of temporary Banality
	per minute to any changeling in his immediate area.
	¥¥¥ Cast off the Scales- mortals who have been Enchanted must make a
	Willpower check or suffer the Fog as if they had a Banality of 8.
	¥¥¥ Falling Leaves- the mutant may touch someone and spend a point of
	Power Charge.  That person will become a miniature Autumn Person for
	one day per point that the victim has in Power Charge, dampening all
	Powers and paranormal activity the way the mutant himself would, except
	with a reduced range of one hundred feet.
	¥¥¥ November Rain- the power dampening effect of Autumn Force lasts for
	one day per point of Power Charge after the mutant leaves the area.
	¥¥¥ Spring Melt- the mutant may temporarily 'shut off' his Power; this
	requires a successful Willpower check, difficulty of 10 minus his
	Intelligence, and lasts for a scene.

Avatar (Social) [AL]
	This ability is rare, but potent.  Basically, the mutant is the
	living symbol or exemplar of a group of people, and can draw upon the
	power of that group.  There is a mutant in China that has the strength
	of all the people in China(!)- he has this Power.  Like the Power
	Life Gestalt, Avatar gives the mutant a far broader pool to draw
	from in one given field of endeavor.  To activate it, the mutant must
	make a Charisma + Empathy roll (diff 7).  The link lasts for the rest
	of the scene, and the mutant will be exhausted afterwards (-2 to all
	actions until he rests for at least an hour).
	
	Common Variations:
	* Strength- the mutant gets one point of Strength from every person
	that he represents.  This replaces (rather than augments) his natural
	strength.  In practice, the mutant's Strength is limited to three times
	his Stamina (all that his body can handle).
	* Willpower- the mutant gets one point of Willpower from every person
	that he represents.  This augments (rather than replaces) his own.
	* Abilities- much like the Dream background, this variation allows
	the mutant to draw upon one "shadow" point of each Talent, Skill, or
	Knowledge that his group possesses (per Rank), to a maximum score
	in any particular Ability equal to the highest score possessed in
	that Ability by the group.
	* Fuel- the mutant can draw upon one Health Level per person to
	fuel kamikaze bursts, etc.  See "Pushing The Envelope".  This does
	not exhaust the mutant beyond the norm for this Power.
	* Psychic Link- the mutant has a psychic link to one person at a
	time in his group, or (with the expenditure of a point of Willpower
	and complete concentration) with all of them.
	
	¥ The mutant represents five people, or can at least draw upon five
	people.
	¥¥ The mutant is connected to ten people
	¥¥¥ Fifteen people
	¥¥¥¥ Twenty people
	¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty-five people
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Forty people
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Fifty people
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ One hundred people
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ One thousand people
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ A nation

Babel Power (Mental) [AL]
	This Power makes all language (oral or physical) impossible to
	interpet.  Anyone affected by it can no longer read or understand
	language (even sign language and body language).  For the duration of
	the effect, players of all affected characters should write down what
	they intend to do each round and pass the note to the GM.  This is a
	telepathic interference Power, and can only be resisted by people who
	have Powers such as Psychic Invulnerability, Psychic Defenses,
	Telepathic Indetectability, and the like.  Telepathic speech is
	unaffected, but Cyphering offers no protection.  Since this Power does
	not rely on direct mind-to-mind contact, but rather a field of
	interference, it requires only low concentration, but affects everyone
	in range (except the mutant).  Roll Wits + Babel Power (diff 7) to
	activate.
	
	¥ The range of the interference field is 10 feet.
	¥¥ The range is 50 feet.
	¥¥¥ 500 feet.
	¥¥¥¥ 1000 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ One mile.

Bardic Voice (Social/Mental) [AL]
	The voice of a bard is as deadly a weapon as a drawn sword.  It can
	be used as a route for power or as a power in itself.  Only by
	silencing a mutant with this power can his enemies be protected from
	it.  The Voice affects each person differently; the mutant must make
	a Charisma + Bardic Voice roll to activate it.  The base difficulty
	is six, which assumes one target that understands the mutant's 
	language.  Add one to the difficulty for each additional person
	involved.  To affect a person who does not understand the mutant's
	language is a +2 difficulty feat; to affect a non-human who does
	not even have the same range of emotional responses is +4.  Once
	activated, the Bardic Voice lasts for as long as the mutant maintains
	light concentration (+1 difficulty to all other rolls, or -1 die to
	all dice pools).
	
	¥ Victims of the Bardic Voice must subtract two from the dice pools
	of any hostile action they take.  Additionally, the Bard uses his Rank
	in Bardic Voice as automatic successes when he applies it to Expression
	or Performance rolls.
	¥¥ Friends of the Bard may be inspired, subtracting one from the
	difficulty of all actions.
	¥¥¥ The Bard may use his Rank in Bardic Voice as automatic successes
	in any Diplomacy, Intimidation, Subterfuge, or Leadership roll in which
	his words are important.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant may use his Voice as a carrier for any Mental Power
	that he might have (such as Telepathy), using the restrictions of both
	Powers in terms of range, number of potential targets, etc. but adding
	the mutant's Rank in Bardic Voice to the dice pool.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The Bard's concentrated scorn, as expressed in the Voice, may
	actually drain away the Willpower of his audience at a rate of one
	point per round.  This may be resisted with Willpower (but naturally,
	it gets harder and harder to resist...)
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The default number of people affected by the Voice becomes
	unlimited; no increase of difficulty accrues when the mutant attempts
	to sway a large crowd.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Charisma- the mutant may purchase the Power: Mega-Charisma with
	experience.
	¥¥ Application- any Mega-Manipulation or Mega-Charisma Power Stunt
	the Bard uses may add his Rank in Bardic Voice to the dice pool.
	¥¥¥ Echoes of the Song- if the mutant speaks a person's language, a
	Perception + Bardic Voice roll allows him to know the songs and legends
	of that person's culture group.
	¥¥¥¥ Carrier- most Social or Mental Powers with an expressible range
	or area of effect (such as Basilisk Field) may instead be carried by
	the Bardic Voice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The Truth- when in Bardic Voice, the mutant may elect to make
	it impossible to speak anything other than the absolute truth-- not
	merely the truth as he knows it.
	
Basilisk Field (Social/Mental) [AL]
	This nasty Power, possessed by the potent and perfidious Mountjoy, 
	takes the form of a field that slows down the reaction time of those 
	caught in it. Those critical seconds that the mutant who employs 
	this Power can earn make it one of the deadlier ones. She is not, of 
	course, affected by her own field.  To activate, the mutant must
	succeed at a Willpower check (difficulty 6).

	¥ The initiative difficulty for all people within five feet of the 
	mutant is 5 instead of four.
	¥¥ Initiative difficulty 6, five feet.
	¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 6, ten feet.
	¥¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 7, ten feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 8, ten feet.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Initiative difficulty 8, fifteen feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Initiative difficulty 8, twenty-five feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 9, fifty feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 9, one hundred feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Initiative difficulty 10, one hundred feet.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Irving- the mutant can subtract her Rank in Basilisk Field from the
	Fast Draw pools of opponents.
	¥ Split Seconds- the mutant is considered to beat anyone who has tied
	her initiative roll; they do not act simultaneously.
	¥¥ Slow and Steady- the difficulty for Dodge rolls for victims of
	this field is increased by one point per two Ranks- diff 7 at Rank
	two, and diff 8 at Rank four.
	¥¥¥ Now You See It- the mutant can make a Wits + Stealth roll to hide
	from anyone who has a lower initiative score, even if she starts the
	round in plain sight.  This is resisted by a Perception + Alertness on
	the part of observers.
	¥¥¥¥ It's Kinetic- the mutant may purchase the Power: Kinetic
	Dampening Field with Experience.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Blunt thinking- the difficulty for all Wits rolls for victims
	of this field is increased by two.  This is not cumulative with any
	other difficulty penalty exacted by this Power.

Bioarchitect's Sight (Physical/Mental) [AN]
	A bizarre ability that allows the mutant to see the 'architecture' of
	living things- all of their parts and processes and how they work.  A
	mutant with this Power will find Medicine and voluntary healing powers
	will be enhanced in their effects.  This understanding of the living
	body is both intuitive and propositional- that is, the mutant need not
	rationalize to understand what he is seeing, but he can use what he
	is seeing for many possible applications.  The mutant can immediately
	see any anomalies, diseases, or damage.  The standard roll is diff 4,
	Perception + Bioarchitect's Sight.  Note that this Power will work only 
	on living things or perfectly preserved corpses (no chemical changes).
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant can see the relationships between the parts of a living
	thing.  All Biomanipulation diffs are reduced by one.  Medicine costs
	only 1 x current, and the time frame for Healing (Others) is cut in
	half.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Attribute Value- the mutant can see the value of a person's
	physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina) as well as that
	person's potential maximum in each of these values.
	¥¥¥ Fatal Flaw- the mutant can see the flaws and weaknesses in a living
	body, and receives one extra die to all damage pools against any living
	organism.
	¥¥¥ Genetic Sight- the mutant can distinguish many Powers by examining
	a person's body.  This is a Perception + Powers Lore roll (difficulty
	varies, base of six for a common Physical Power, +1 for Social, +2 for
	Mental, +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare).  The Attunement and Dormancy
	Backgrounds may also be distinguished in this way, treated as uncommon
	Social Powers.
	¥¥¥ Health Value- the mutant can see how much damage a person has
	taken, what sort of damage it is (bashing, lethal, aggravated, or
	permanent), and how quickly the person's natural processes will heal
	the next level of damage.

Biological Vampirism (Physical) [PN]
	A mutant with this Power, like Morbius the Living Vampire, has the
	need to feed on the living to survive, and what he requires is their
	blood.  He is not undead, or repelled by crosses.  He can walk around
	in broad daylight if he chooses.  He drains the blood from the bodies
	of his victims and is sustained and empowered by it.  The mutant must
	feed on at least one Health Levels worth of blood per day, for he
	loses Health at the rate of one Level per day.  Every time he drains
	blood, he restores a Health Level of normal damage.  Aggravated damage
	must heal on its own.  The mutant does not need any other food or
	drink.  No roll is required, aside from a normal roll to hit.  A
	grapple may be required to suck the blood of a struggling victim.  The
	mutant's bite inflicts Str + 1 damage.
	
	Variation: Wendigo- instead of blood, the mutant requires living
	flesh-- muscle tissue, fat, marrow, and the like.
	
	Variation: No Kiss Required- for an extra three freebie points, the
	mutant merely has to touch his victims (like Bloodscream) in order
	to drain their blood.  Sucking on open wounds is not necessary.  In
	fact, wounds of any kind are not needed. [AN]
	
	Special Flaw: Sunlight Allergy (7 pt. Flaw)- like Morbius, the mutant
	takes serious damage from sunlight.  This amounts to one unsoakable,
	aggravated Health Level of damage a round with any direct exposure.
	Serious cloud cover might allow a soak roll.
	
	Special Merit (Wendigo only): Meat eater (3 pt. Merit)- the flesh does
	not have to be living to be metabolized by the mutant.  Fresh, raw,
	unprocessed meat will do.  However, it must still be the flesh of
	sentient beings.

	Common Variations:
	* Strength- the mutant can spend his own Health Levels, one-for-one,
	to boost his Strength for a scene.
	* Speed- the mutant can spend a Health Level for an extra action (max
	of one).
	* Stamina- the mutant can spend Health Levels to boost his Stamina
	for a scene, one for one.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant has, in fact, become a living Vampire.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Blood Tracking- once the mutant has tasted the blood of a particular
	person, she will be able to follow him to the ends of the earth.  The
	vampire gets a sense of how far away the person is, and in what direction
	he lies, with light concentration (+1 diffs to all other actions)

Biomanipulation (Physical/Social) [AH]
	The mutant has gained the ability to mess with the body functions of
	others.  This can cause seem exceedingly nasty effects, and even death
	in some cases.  Shinobi Shaw of the Hellfire Club has an employee with
	this Power.  Most of the time, this is a Manipulation +
	Biomanipulation roll (diff of the victim's Stamina + Athletics).  Each
	point of Invulnerability that the victim has increases the number of
	successes required by two.

	¥ Cause or alleviate minor pain (+/- 1 to dice penalties).  Cannot
	create dice bonuses.
	¥¥ Cause or alleviate moderate pain or minor damage (+/- 2 to dice
	penalties, one die of bashing or lethal damage)
	¥¥¥ Cause or alleviate major pain or moderate damage (+/- 3 to
	dice penalties, two dice of bashing or lethal damage)
	¥¥¥¥ Cause or alleviate severe pain or major damage (+/- 4 to
	dice penalties, three dice of bashing or lethal damage)
	¥¥¥¥¥ Cause or alleviate chronic pain or severe damage (+/- 5 to
	dice penalties, four dice of bashing or lethal damage)
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Blindness- the mutant can induce sensory deprivation of any or
	all sorts in a target.
	¥¥¥ Mood Swing- the mutant can manipulate the production of
	serotonin and other emotion-governing chemicals in the brain to
	alter a victim's mood (Manipulation + Biomanipulation, diff 7,
	opposed by the victim's Stamina + Empathy).
	¥¥¥ Slow metabolism- the mutant can put others in a sleepy state of
	suspended animation, a death-like state wherein breathing and pulse
	are virtually indetectible.
	¥¥¥¥ Clot- the blood can be made to clot up, causing strokes and
	other nasty surprises.  In addition to normal damage, this can
	have serious effects on the normal function of the victim after
	the assault.
	¥¥¥¥ Healing- the mutant may purchase the Power: Healing (Others)
	with Experience.

Blood Armour (Physical) [AN]
	By no means is this a common Power, but it is one of the quickest and
	easiest ways to protect someone or something.  The mutant cuts himself
	(one Health Level of damage) or is cut, and spills the blood on an
	object.  The mutant's blood has a few unusual properties, including
	self-directed movement.  It will flow over and around the object
	(pulling more blood out of the cut if necessary to do so- inflicting
	more damage) and begin to thicken, expand, and coagulate. At the end
	of the round, it is as hard as Kevlar, but more flexible. Moreover, it
	is still fluid, and will move to seal up any gaps that appear in its
	surface.  Note that this armour is still made of blood (albeit strange
	blood) and will burn or freeze.  It supplies little protection against
	most energy attacks, but excellent protection against physical attacks
	of all sorts.  The Blood Armour may be commanded to return to its
	normal, liquid state by a sort of telepathic order from its donor. 
	Blood Armour is a sentient being of sorts, and has an Intelligence of
	1.  One Health Level of Blood Armour is sufficient to cover one
	man-sized object. Every extra Health Level of Blood Armour that is
	invested beyond the minimum level necessary will result in a
	cumulative -1 Dexterity dice penalty.  A Willpower check may be
	required to control the Blood Armour.
	
	¥ One extra soak die per Health Level
	¥¥ Two extra soak dice per Health Level
	¥¥¥ Three extra soak dice per Health Level
	¥¥¥¥ Four extra soak dice per Health Level
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five extra soak dice per Health Level
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six soak dice and one auto-soak per Health Level
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven soak dice and one auto-soak
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Seven soak dice and two auto-soak
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Eight soak dice and two auto-soak
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Eight soak dice and three auto-soak
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Clot- the Blood Armour can be made to form an instant scab
	when the mutant is cut, giving him an extra soak die against all
	cutting attacks.
	¥¥¥ Self-Cleansing- the Blood Armour immediately dispels any sort
	of impurity, which means that it can actually be reintroduced
	into the mutant's veins (healing the damage that he took by
	losing it).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Armour Infection- the Blood Armour, upon making contact with
	any other blood, immediately initiates a reaction which turns that
	Blood into Blood Armour (effectively giving the original Blood
	Armour more soak dice).

Blood Kinship (Physical) [AL]
	A vampiric Power of sorts, Blood Kinship creates a special bond
	between a bloodsucker and his victim.  A mutant with this Power
	does not have to drink blood to live, but he is capable of doing
	so if he wishes, and on precious little blood, at that.  Unlike
	a Biological Vampire, a mutant with this Power cannot spend his
	Blood (Health Levels) for power, but he uses this Blood in a 
	different way.  The mutant forms a bond with the victim, which has 
	the following effects:

	* The mutant knows where the bloodsource is at all times
	* The mutant has the ability to speak, mind-to-mind, to the
	bloodsource at all times.  This works like conversation, not
	mind-reading.
	* The mutant can take on the physical appearance of the bloodsource,
	including such minutiae as voice, tattoos, etc.  The mutant retains
	his own physical attributes (except Appearance), but may not use
	his Powers while in that form.

	This bond lasts only one day, after which the blood is digested-
	unless the mutant is willing to sacrifice a Health Level to
	'fill' with the Blood and perpetuate the Kinship.  This lasts
	until the mutant decides to expel or digest the blood, which
	immediately restores the lost Health Level.

	Note: A mutant may have a Blood Kinship with only one bloodsource
	at a time, unless she has dedicated at least one Health Level to
	keeping a Kinship.
	
	Special Flaw: No Fangs (1 pt.)- the mutant does not receive the
	fang and jaw modifications, and can not make direct biting attacks
	as normal.  This Flaw can not be taken if the mutant has purchased
	Body Weaponry (Fangs) or something similar.
	
	Special Merit: Lick (4 pt.)- like a vampire, the mutant can choose
	to close the wounds he inflicts while biting simply by licking the
	wound.  This can heal up to one Health Level of damage.

	¥ The mutant gets tiny fangs and a greatly strengthened jaw, which
	allows her to inflict Str + 1 damage against a foe.  The mutant may
	elect to drink the foe's blood once she bites him, which inflicts an
	automatic Health Level of damage per round (unsoakable) thereafter
	until she is dislodged.
	¥¥ The mutant can stare at her bloodsource and paralyze him (The
	victim must roll successes on his Stamina equal to the mutant's Rank
	in this Power to resist), which lasts as long as eye contact is
	maintained.
	¥¥¥ The mutant may access the memories of the bloodsource as if
	they were her own.  No roll is required.  This does not include
	Skills, Talents, or Knowledges.
	¥¥¥¥ While taking on the victim's visage, the mutant may use his
	Skills, Talents, and Knowledges.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant may use the victim's Powers, if any, while in
	his form.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Extra Health Levels- the mutant may purchase Extra Health Levels
	once she has purchased this Stunt, even if she is not a Physical
	character and has not taken that Power.  If she is a Social character,
	they cost 12 points each.  If she is a Mental character, they cost
	15 points each.  The mutant's Stamina limits the number of Extra
	Health Levels that she may have.

Body Armour (Physical) [PN]
	Simply stated, the mutant has some kind of natural covering which makes
	him resistant to damage of all sorts.  This can be a very ugly
	covering, or it can be more subtle (compare the Thing to Colossus) but
	in any case it is a visible power.  Energy and kinetic damage, edged or
	blunt, are less likely to harm this character.  This power often proves
	a liability in social situations, though it can be intimidating.  Note
	that Colossus has BOTH Body Armour and Matter Body- a most deadly
	combination.  No roll is required. 
	
	Variation: Body Resistance- Rogue has this variation, which is not
	visible to the naked eye.  It may be a strange energy field that
	surrounds the body, or the skin may simply remain supple while being as
	damage resistant as armoured plate.  In any case, it costs three extra
	Freebie points at character creation.
	
	¥ One automatic soak success against physical attacks, one extra soak
	die against energy attacks, one extra Health Level.  When the extra
	Health level is lost, so is the soaking bonus associated with the Body
	Armour (until the armour is healed/repaired).
	¥¥ Two auto soak or two extra dice, two Health
	¥¥¥ Three auto soak or dice, three Health
	¥¥¥¥ Four auto soak or dice, four Health
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five auto soak or dice, five Health
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six automatic soak or dice, six Health, damage is reduced by
	one severity type (aggravated to lethal, lethal to bashing.  Immunity
	to bashing damage.  Lethal-- now bashing-- damage goes to the end of 
	the armour's Health levels and wraps around before the mutant takes
	any damage).  Permanent damage is not reduced in severity.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven automatic soak or dice, seven Health
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight automatic soak or dice, eight Health, mutant does
	not take damage from the first attack that penetrates the armour's
	defenses (unless the attack ignores armour)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine automatic soak or dice, nine Health
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten automatic soak or dice, ten Health, damage is reduced
	by two severity types (aggravated to bashing, immunity to lethal and
	bruising damage).  Permanent damage is not reduced in severity.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Frightening Form- add your Body Armour dice to any Intimidation
	dice pools.
	¥ Shift Form- the mutant can change between an armoured form and an
	unarmoured form.  This obviates the social penalties.  This Stunt
	can rarely be bought with experience.
	¥¥ Parry- the mutant may use toughened parts of her body to deflect
	weapons and bullets; each success on the Dex + Brawl removes one die
	from the damage pool of the weapon.
	¥¥¥ Regenerate- as an action, the mutant may concentrate to restore
	the Health levels of his armour.  This is a Charisma + Body Armour
	roll (diff 8)- each success restores one such Health Level.

Body Doppelganger* (Physical/Social) [AH]
	Recently, this Power was displayed by Coy Nga (Karma's little sister).
	It is the ability to create a duplicate body out of thin air (or some
	physical process -- yucky!) with the Powers of the duplicated target,
	who must be within line of sight.  The mutant then controls this new
	body, leaving her old one largely inert until this new body is
	banished.  Not socially acceptable.  The Powers associated with the
	mutant's normal body cannot be used while she is controlling the
	Doppelganger.  A Manipulation + Doppelganger roll (difficulty of
	10 - the mutant's Stamina) is required to establish control over this 
	new body, or return to the old one.
	
	¥ Bodies with no physical attribute higher than 6 can be duplicated,
	with all Powers at Rank one (if a duplicate was made of Magneto at
	this Rank, it would have Magnetic Control ¥, for instance) if possible.
	Powers that cannot be reduced in Rank are not duplicated.
	¥¥ No physical attribute higher than 7, Powers are Rank two or less.
	¥¥¥ No physical attribute higher than 8, Powers are Rank three or
	less.
	¥¥¥¥ No physical attribute higher than 9, Powers are Rank four or
	less.
	¥¥¥¥¥ No physical attribute higher than 10, Powers are Rank five or
	less.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Intimate- if the mutant knows a person extremely well (she's married
	to him, etc.) she can duplicate him even when he is not present.

Body Part Forging* (Physical) [AH]
	This Power is related to Shapeshifting and Extra Body Parts.  A
	character with this ability can grow new body parts for himself with
	concentration- these are generally temporary additions.  The character
	can also change the structure of his existing body parts to his 
	specifications so long as he is familiar with the structure of the part 
	that he wishes to be the end product.  One does not construct compound 
	eyes without having knowledge of how and why they function, nor without 
	familiarity with how they are built.  Thus, the Biology and Medicine 
	knowledges are vital to a character with Body Part Forging.

	The first part of the Power involves forging parts that duplicate
	pre-existing parts- for instance, growing a third eye.  This requires
	a simple Stamina + Body Part Forging roll, with a difficulty as follows:

	Simple/small part (finger, toe, hair, tooth, simple muscle): Diff 4
	Simple/large part (hand, arm, leg, foot): Diff 6
	Complex part (lung, kidney, heart, tongue): Diff 8
	Very complex part (eye, nose, ear, etc.): Diff 9
	Ridiculously complex part (brain): Diff 10

	The Storyteller may demand several successes for some tasks- for
	instance, in growing a third arm, a mutant makes a mess of existing
	muscle and bone patterns.  Several minute adjustments may be required
	to get a new body part to work.

	The more complicated use for this Power involves creating or changing
	a body part to a form that has no precedent in the mutant's natural
	body- for instance, growing compound eyes, or wings.  This requires a
	successful Intelligence + Biology roll (diff 6, three successes) and
	a further Intelligence + Medicine roll (diff varies with how alien the
	change is to the physiology of the mutant: 7-10, three successes)
	before beginning, and then follows the same guide for difficulty as
	above, with qualifications- for instance, creating compound eyes would
	require changes to the brain in order to process the sensory data,
	and so would be a difficulty 10 roll rather than difficulty 9.

	Note that all of the physiological changes that are required to 
	create the new part occur concurrently, and require only one roll-
	the difficulty of which is that for the most demanding change.

	¥ Transformation takes 1 round for a small, simple part; 3 rounds
	for a large simple part; 5 rounds for a complex part; 7 rounds for
	a very complex part; 10 rounds for a ridiculously complex part.  The
	changes last one scene or until the character deliberately reverts
	to his original shape, which takes 1 round.
	¥¥ Transformation takes 1 round for any simple part, 3 for complex
	parts, 5 for very complex parts, 7 for ridiculously complex parts.
	¥¥¥ Transformation takes 1 round for any simple or complex part, 3
	for very complex parts, 5 for ridiculously complex parts.
	¥¥¥¥ Transformation takes 1 round for any simple, complex, or very
	complex part, 3 rounds for ridiculously complex parts.
	¥¥¥¥¥ All changes take a single round.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ All difficulties are reduced by one category (simple, small
	parts are still diff 4).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can split her dice pool to forge multiple parts
	in one round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ All difficulties are further reduced by one category.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Transformations that the mutant makes often no longer
	require a roll; they still take the full amount of time.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ All changes are instantaneous.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Bulk up: The mutant can temporarily add to his Strength score
	by adding new muscle fibres.  Since the human body does not normally
	add new fibres in this way, a strain on ligaments and other tissues
	is quite likely under stress.
	¥¥¥ Permanence: The mutant may spend a Permanent Willpower point to
	make a change permanent- allowing him to regrow lost parts, or
	merely make sure that he can keep those wings.

Body Weaponry (Physical) [PN]
	Quite simply, the mutant has a built-in set of weapons.  This arsenal
	can be as simple as Sabretooth's finger claws, or as strange as
	Random's built-in guns (though he gets them through a combination of
	this power and Shapeshifting) or as disgusting as Riptide's skin-made
	shuriken.  If it is a projectile weapon, every point of Body Weaponry
	translates to a Health Level of damage plus 1 (so the deadly Random, with
	Body Weaponry ¥¥¥¥¥, has a set of damage 6 guns that he can pull out).
	If it is a Melee weapon, the damage is Strength + 1 + the rank of the
	Power.  Thus, Wolverine's teeth are Body Weaponry ¥ (dam Str + 2) while
	his claws are Body Weaponry ¥¥¥ (dam Str + 4).  In any case, the mutant's
	difficulties to hit with these natural weapons are at -1.  There must be
	a good reason supplied for improving this power or buying new Power
	Stunts with experience points.  No roll apart from rolls to hit are
	required.
	
	¥ Str +2 melee or damage 2 projectile
	¥¥ Str +3 or damage 3
	¥¥¥ Str +4 or dam 4
	¥¥¥¥ Str +5 or dam 5
	¥¥¥¥¥ Str +6 or dam 6
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Str +7, difficulty 5 damage tests
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Str +8
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Str +8, difficulty 4 damage tests
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Str +9
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Str +10, difficulty 3 damage tests

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Unlimited ammunition- for projectile weapons only.  The mutant will
	never run out of stuff to throw, fling, or shoot.
	¥¥ Retractable- the larger weapons often look ugly or alarming.  This
	Power Stunt allows you to hide them.
	¥¥¥ Hardness- the mutant's weapon is hard enough that it can cut or
	smash through very strong materials.  See the Power: Matter Hardening
	and compare Ranks to get an idea of what the mutant can affect.  Note
	that unless the mutant has the Stunt: Preternatural Sharpness, his
	Strength is also considered as a cap for the maximum hardness of the
	material he can cut.
	¥¥¥¥ Preternatural Sharpness- Requires the Stunt: Hardness.  The
	mutant's weaponry ignores any automatic soaks that the target material
	has due to enhanced toughness (including Body Armour, Body Weaponry,
	Invulnerability, and Matter Body), so long as its Rank is equal to or
	higher than the material strength of the target.  See Matter Hardening
	to get an idea.  Note that the Background: Adamantium allows a weapon
	with this Stunt to ignore auto soak for materials two Ranks higher than
	that of the weapon.  If the weapon is blunt, then assume its perfect
	composition creates catastrophic resonance problems for the target.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Aggravated- the mutant's weaponry inflicts Aggravated instead of
	Lethal damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Evil wounds- healing Powers, such as Healing Factor, Healing
	(Others), and Accelerated Recovery do not function against wounds
	inflicted by a weapon with this stunt; the victim heals at the normal
	human rate.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Taint- the merest scratch from the mutant's weapon can be
	deadly. If the victim does not succeed on his initial soak roll
	against a successful hit, the weapon inflicts taint, and will cause
	secondary damage.  There are a variety of taints possible, including
	extra damage (if the victim takes two Health Levels of damage from the
	weapon, he must soak two Health Levels per round for a number of
	rounds equal to the mutant's Rank), Willpower drain (the victim loses
	a point of Willpower for every point of taint), Strength drain, or
	even Power Charge drain.  The mutant picks one kind of taint when he
	first tries this Stunt.  Note that only the extra damage taint is an
	ongoing effect, and taint does not accumulate.

Body Weaponry Forging (Physical) [AL]
	Like Killrazor of Top Cow's Stryke Force or Riptide of the Marauders,
	a mutant with this Power can concentrate and create weapons out of his
	own body.  These are usually melee-type weapons, though as Riptide
	demonstrates, missile weapons are also possible.  The only real limit
	to the size and number of weapons that the mutant can create is his
	own endurance.  The player chooses at the time that he selects this
	Power whether the weapons will be melee or missile weapons.  To forge
	a weapon with this Power takes an action.

	Up to one melee weapon per point of Stamina can exist at a time. The
	number of missile weapons can vary with the desires of the mutant- for
	example, Riptide gets four successes on a Stamina roll.  He can either
	exude one damage 4 shuriken, or four damage 1 shuriken, or two damage
	2 shuriken, or any other combination.  All of these together count as
	'one' weapon- so he could stockpile them in large numbers for later.

	If the mutant gets more successes on his Stamina roll than he has
	Ranks in this power, he must soak one Health Level of damage for every
	die of difference. These weapons can be formed from any part of the
	mutant's body. They last until he decides to pull them back into his
	body.  They are usually metallic in composition, though they may be of
	any sort that the player wants and the Storyteller will agree to.

	¥ The mutant can create weapons from his own body.  Roll the mutant's
	Stamina + Body Weaponry Forging, difficulty 9.  For every success on
	this roll, the weapon will have an additional damage die.  One success
	equals a Strength + 1 weapon or a damage 2 missile weapon.
	¥¥ The difficulty is eight.
	¥¥¥ Difficulty seven.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulty six.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulty five.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Difficulty five, the weapon limit increases to two per point of 
	Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Difficulty five, the limit is three per point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Difficulty four.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Difficulty four, the limit is four per point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulty four, the limit is five per point.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Vary Shape- the mutant, by spending a point of Willpower, can
	set the shape of the weapon that he is creating- thus, even shields
	(add their damage rating to the character's Parry dice) can be
	forged.

Chameleon Power (Physical/Social) [AL]
	This ability allows a mutant to change his color, and in some extreme
	cases, even his smell, to make him more difficult to detect.  This
	is not exactly invisibility, and the mutant becomes easier to detect
	if he does not move slowly.  Nightcrawler's Blending is a weak variant
	of this power.  You might consider the Predator.  Roll Stamina
	(diff 4) to activate this Power.
	
	¥ +1 die to Stealth dice pools when activated.  It takes one round to
	change color to suit surroundings; this takes concentration.  If the
	mutant does not move, he is at +1 difficulty to be detected.
	¥¥ +2 dice to Stealth dice pools when activated.  A change in colour
	takes one action to accomplish.  No movement, +2 diff to be detected.
	¥¥¥ +3 dice to Stealth dice pools when activated.  Continuous change
	in colour is possible with light concentration- the mutant can walk,
	talk, etc. while changing colouration, but not fight or defuse a bomb.
	+3 diff to be detected when the mutant is not moving.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant adds 4 dice to Stealth dice pools.  The change in colour
	is instinctive, and does not require concentration.  At night, the
	mutant's enemies are at +2 difficulty to hit him with missile weapons,
	even in combat.  +3 diff to be detected when motionless.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant adds 5 dice to Stealth dice pools.  The mutant is at
	+3 difficulty to be hit with missile weapons at night, as above, and
	+2 diff to be hit in normal melee in the same situation.  Any time the
	mutant is in surroundings of roughly one colour, this bonus applies.
	+4 diff to be detected when motionless. (Max 10)
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Conscious Shift- The mutant can change his colours not only to suit
	his surroundings, but to whatever colours he pleases.  This can serve
	to attract attention, or can aid in disguise.
	¥¥ False Sickness- Requires Conscious Shift.  The mutant can simulate
	the appearance of conditions like measles, leprosy, dirtiness, etc.
	using this power- or hide the signs of these conditions.
	¥¥¥ Mirror Appearance- The mutant has mastered the art of changing how
	his body reacts to light to the point where he can reflect light with
	his body like a mirror.  This has a variety of applications, but serves
	as 2 points of automatic soak successes vs. light attacks per point of
	Chameleon Power.
	¥¥¥ Mask Scent- The mutant's smell also changes to suit his surroundings.
	Against creatures with a strong sense of smell, or reliance on the
	same, add +1 to your Stealth pool per level of Chameleon Power.
	¥¥¥ Light Control- The mutant who purchases this Power Stunt may buy
	the power: Light Control with experience, even if he did not start
	the game with that power.

Chaos Field (Social) [AN]
	The mutant who possesses this power will find himself the center of a
	storm of chance. Luck and Probabilities will shift wildly around him,
	yet he will have no control over their flow. He will stand at the
	epicenter of a storm of chaos, never quite sure what to expect next.

	This power is not controllable by the player character. At the
	beginning of each session, the Storyteller rolls a number of dice
	equal to the character's Manipulation + Chaos Field. If more odds than
	evens show, then the positive modifier will be in effect. If there are
	more even numbers than odds, then the negative modifier is applied. If
	the ratio of odds to evens is equal, than Lady Luck has decided to
	keep herself neutral, and this power will not work at all for that
	session. In addition a mutant with this power may not purchase
	Luck/Probability Manipulation, Possibility Forging or any other
	related powers.

	Special Flaw: Twist of Chance (2 pt.)- whenever the mutant rolls two
	or more tens (or two or more ones) in a single roll, reality twists
	for the rest of the scene.  Minor weird occurrences (like all the
	stitches suddenly unraveling in a person's pants, or clocks running
	backward) will occur in the area around the mutant.

	Special Flaw: Rule of Entropy (1 pt.)- any use of a probability-
	altering Power within the mutant's aura (such as Luck/Probability
	Manipulation, Hex Power, Distortion Beam, or Possibility Forging) will
	result in wild and unpredictable results. The ST is encouraged to be
	cruel.

	¥ The mutant has an aura extending 50 feet from her body in all
	directions. Those caught inside this area will experience either a
	+1 or a -1 die modifier to all dice pools, depending on how fickle
	luck is feeling that day.
	¥¥ The mutant has an aura extending 100 feet from her body.
	¥¥¥ As before, only the aura is extended to 175 feet. Also in addition
	to the overall modifier to dice pools, either +1 or -1 is factored
	into the highest die of each roll (the modifier is positive if the
	dice pool modifier is positive, negative if the overall modifier is
	negative, the Storyteller makes only the one deciding roll at the
	beginning of each session).
	¥¥¥¥ The aura is now 250 feet, extending in all directions
	(including up and down). The overall modifier is now either +2 or -2
	dice from the dice pools of everyone caught in the aura, and the
	+1/-1 modifier is applied to the highest two dice of each roll.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The aura is now 500 feet in all directions.  The overall mod is
	2, with a +1/-1 applied to the highest and lowest two dice of each
	roll.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Low-End/High End- by expending a point of Power Charge, the mutant
	can expand his botch range to 1-2, and the reroll range to 9-10 for a
	scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Expand Chaos- the mutant can "ripple" the effect with
	concentration and a point of Power Charge.  Every party in the aura
	must roll one die.  If it is odd, he gets the bonus.  If it is even,
	he gets the penalty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Concentrated Chaos- the mutant spends a point of Power Charge to
	greatly expand the effect of his field for one round (each victim adds
	his Charisma dice to his bonus or penalty dice for that round).

Charge Building (Social) [AH]
	For most mutants, Power Charge builds slowly.  Even for those with the
	Power: Accelerated Recovery, the metabolic energy returns at an hourly
	rate.  Mutants with this Power, however, have managed to tap into a
	wellspring of energy and convert it directly to metabolic energy.  This
	allows them to quickly rebuild their charge when it has been depleted,
	and even push it beyond normal limits.  A Stamina + Charge Building roll
	(difficulty of the mutant's current Power Charge + 2) is required to use
	this Power.
	
	¥¥¥ With concentration, the mutant can restore one Power Charge per round.
	This (obviously) takes an action.  The mutant cannot build Power Charge 
	and expend it in the same round.  In addition, the mutant can temporarily 
	store up to three Power Charge above his normal limit; however, this must 
	be spent at the end of five rounds, or the mutant will take one Health 
	Level of aggravated damage per point of excess charge (this is soakable at 
	diff 8).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can store up to four Power Charge above the limit; this must
	be spent at the end of seven rounds.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can store up to five Power Charge above the limit; this
	must be spent by the end of the combat.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can build Power Charge at a rate of two points per round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Three points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Four points.  Ten extra points of Power Charge above the limit.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Five points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Five points.  Fifteen extra Power Charge can be stored.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Immutable Pattern- the incredible volume of metabolic energy coursing 
	through your body serves as a solvent for pattern anomalies.  You may
	purchase the Power: Immutable Pattern with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Supercharge- The mutant may boost his effective Rank in an Energy
	Power for one round by expending two points of Power Charge per Rank.
	¥¥¥¥ Dormancy- the mutant may purchase the Dormancy Background with
	Experience (at a cost equal to that of abilities).
	¥¥¥¥ Nullification Resistance- the mutant may use his Rank in this
	Power to 'soak' Power Dampening or Nullification by taking an action
	to resist.  If the Dampening or Nullification is established in a
	round when the mutant has no action left, he loses his chance to
	resist it.

Charge Draining Field* (Social) [AL]
	The mutant can erect a field of negative energy that drains away the
	Power Charge from all those who enter it.  The field becomes stronger
	as it drains energy, actually taking on a physical form (that will
	prevent the escape of those being drained, or keep out people not in
	the area of the field already).  It has no effect on flatscans, and it
	won't inconvenience mutants who have only passive Powers.  A
	Manipulation + CDF roll (difficulty of the mutant's own Power Charge)
	is required to erect the field.

	Variation: System Shock- for four extra Freebie points, if a victim is
	drained to zero Power Charge with this Power, she must make a Stamina
	check (at diff of the mutant's score in temporary Power Charge) or
	lose consciousness.

	¥ The field can drain away one point of Power Charge per round, until all
	people in the field have a temporary Power Charge rating equal to the
	mutant's own temporary Power Charge.  Each point drained away will fuel
	one minute of forcefield, which acts as a Rank ¥ forcefield.  The field
	itself is 10 feet in radius.
	¥¥ The field, once charged, will act as a Rank ¥¥ forcefield, and has a
	15 foot radius.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can drain Power Charge until all mutants in the field have
	a temporary rating equal to (10 - the mutant's own score in temporary
	Power Charge).  He can also elect to drain Charge as per Rank ¥ in this
	Power, but he must choose when he erects the field which method to use.
	To change, he must drop the field (and lose all temporary Charge that he
	has drained).  The field is 20 feet in radius, and will act as a Rank ¥¥¥
	forcefield when charged.
	¥¥¥¥ The field will act as a Rank ¥¥¥¥ forcefield when charged, and has a
	25 foot radius.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The field will act as a Rank ¥¥¥¥¥ forcefield when charged, and has
	a 40 foot radius.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Overdrain- the mutant can spend a point of Willpower to drain a
	victim to the dregs (i.e., zero Power Charge)

Clairaudience/Clairvoyance (Mental) [AH]
	These powers allow the mutant to use one of her senses at a distance.
	Clairaudience extends the range of the mutant's hearing, while the
	power of Clairvoyance gives far-sight.  Of course, Clairolfactory
	powers are also possible, but probably useless unless you have a sense
	of smell like Wolverine's or Daredevil's.  Note that this does not
	increase the actual physical range of your senses; rather, it allows
	you to see or hear from places other than your eyes or ears.  Sort of
	like invisible 'foster eyes'.  Note that this power can be detected by
	telepaths and people with the Awareness or Intuition talents, so be
	careful who you spy upon.  The Peeper (featured in the Mort of the
	Month) has the power of Clairvoyance. Roll Perception + Rank (diff 4 +
	range category- see below) to activate this Power.

	¥ Can shift the sense data-gathering location up to one mile distant.
	¥¥ Range of fifty miles.
	¥¥¥ One thousand miles.
	¥¥¥¥ The world!
	¥¥¥¥¥ The solar system.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere in this galaxy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in this dimension

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Been There- any alternate dimension that the mutant has
	visited may be viewed at Rank ¥ ability (up to one mile from any
	location in the dimension that the mutant has visited).

Colocation (Physical/Social) [AL]
	Colocation is the ability to appear in more than one place at the same
	time.  This is not the same as duplication; the mutant's single body
	actually appears in several places at once.  There are several uses
	for this Power for the creative mind to exploit.  It requires light
	concentration to establish and maintain; if the mutant is ever hit
	with more damage in one round than he has points of Stamina (even if
	it is all soaked), the Power is disrupted until he can establish it
	again. Roll Stamina + Colocation (diff 6 + the number of places the
	mutant already exists) to activate this Power.  Dispelling the effect
	is automatic and does not take an action.
	
	¥ The mutant can colocate as far away as 5 metres
	¥¥ Anywhere within 100 metres
	¥¥¥ Anywhere within line of sight, or one mile
	¥¥¥¥ Anywhere within ten miles
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere within 100 miles
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere within 1000 miles
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere on the planet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Anywhere in the solar system
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Anywhere in the galaxy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere in the universe
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Object colocation- by keeping in continuous contact with an
	object, the mutant may make it colocate without colocating himself.
	This is a Manipulation + Colocation (diff 6 + the number of places
	the object already exists).

Combat Sense (Physical/Mental) [AN]
	This power gives a mutant a supernatural ability in combat to sense
	the actions of others and react accordingly.  For every point in this
	Power, the mutant has a point of Wits and Perception for combat 
	purposes only.  Rogue stole this power from Ms. Marvel.  This Power is
	not subject to Psychic Defenses, unlike Combat Telepathy (q.v.)
	No roll is normally required, but if one is required, it is usually
	either Perception + Combat Sense or Wits + Combat Sense.
	
	¥ One extra point of Wits and Perception while in combat
	¥¥ Two points
	¥¥¥ Three points
	¥¥¥¥ Four points
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six points; the mutant can buy the Talent: Intuition
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven points; the mutant can also add these points to
	all Evasion rolls
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight points; the mutant can roll Wits + Combat Sense
	instead of Wits + Alertness for initiative purposes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine points; all Dodge difficulties are reduced by
	one (bringing the total to two if the mutant has the Dodge stunt)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten points; the mutant can buy the Talent: Awareness
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ New Player- the mutant always notices when a character joins or
	leaves a melee.
	¥ Sucker Punch- this stunt allows the mutant to take a hit from a
	character for reduced damage (diff 5 to soak) in order to sucker that
	character into taking a harsher hit.  After the mutant takes the hit
	(he cannot dodge it) his next attack that round with have one automatic
	success either to hit or to damage for every success on a Power roll.
	This stunt fails automatically against a character with Combat Sense
	or Combat Telepathy.
	¥¥ Intuition- the mutant may purchase the Talent: Intuition.
	¥¥ Last call- the player of this mutant always announces what his
	character is going to do last, even if he wins initiative.
	¥¥¥ Dodge- All dodge difficulties are reduced by one.
	¥¥¥¥ Combat Telepathy- the mutant can buy the Combat Telepathy power
	with experience, even if she did not start the game with that power,
	once she purchases this Power Stunt.

Combat Telepathy (Mental) [AL]
	This telepathic variant allows a mutant to sense what his opponent is
	doing an instant before he does it by reading a certain sector of the
	of the opponent's mind.  This is a very specialized form of Telepathy,
	as it does not read surface thoughts, but rather intentions (which in
	combat, are pretty darn vague).  Cable has the aggressive version of
	this power.  This usually requires a Perception + Combat TP roll
	(difficulty of the opposing Willpower).
	
	¥ The mutant can choose either to decrease his opponent's dice pool
	to hit him or damage him by 1, or increase his own dice pool to hit 
	or to damage by the same amount.
	¥¥ As above, except the mutant the modifier is two dice.  When the
	opponent announces that he is going to use an energy attack or a mental
	attack, the mutant has the option to use his action at that point if
	he still has one left.
	¥¥¥ All physical attacks made vs. the mutant can be dodged without an
	action.  The modifier is 3 dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice can be added or subtracted, in any combination.  (Two
	dice taken from the opponent's damage pool, one added to your hit
	pool, one to your damage pool).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice can be added or subtracted.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can use this Power against two opponents at once.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Three opponents.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Four opponents.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Five opponents.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Everyone present.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Custom Feint- By reading the victim's intentions carefully, the
	mutant can execute a feint that seems to play right into the
	opponent's hands... the opponent will find himself in a bad position
	to dodge the mutant's attack if this maneuver (Manipulation + Combat
	TP, difficulty of the opponent's Wits + Brawl) succeeds, leaving him
	at a +1 difficulty to Dodge per success.  This is a difficulty 8
	maneuver.
	¥¥ Last call- the player always declares her action for the round
	last, regardless of her initiative roll.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Aggressive Combat TP- The mutant can attempt to implant a simple
	suggestion as an intention- that is, he can control one of his
	opponent's actions as an action.  Powers can be used or attacks can be
	made.  The difficulty is the opponent's Willpower + 3, in a resisted
	roll against the mutant's Manipulation + Combat TP. [AH]

Composite Body (Physical) [AL]
	Oh my, this is a weird one.  Your mutant's body, in this case, is made
	up of the living bodies of several other organisms.  These organisms,
	naturally, are much smaller than your mutant.  Most mutants have two
	basic appearances when they are 'whole'- a normal human appearance, and
	a composite appearance.  Yucky.  Common examples of organisms used to
	make up the composite are spiders, worms, and mice.  In any case, the
	mutant, when in his composite body, can choose at any time to
	'disengage' the body and send the smaller organisms scattering in all
	directions.  He can still exert some small control over them at this
	point, even directing attacks.  If any of the animals in the composite
	have Powers (such as a powerful venom, in the case of some snakes and
	spiders), then the mutant must purchase that Power, but will also have
	it in his regular body.  In fact, he will have any such ability that the
	animals have, including wings, gills, etc.  The same is not true of the
	animals in the composite, but see below.
	
	Variation: All Composite*- the mutant does not have to make up his body
	with the same kind of animal each time.  He can change this when he
	disengages the composite body.  A sort of attraction wave spreads out
	from the place where he disengaged, and various of the new sort of
	animal head for that place as quickly as they can.  They will make up
	the new body.  Note that the character's human body will look a bit
	different after he changes the composite.
	
	Variation: All the Time [PL] - this variant costs two Freebies or
	Experience less per Rank, and is a good reason to buy the Flaw:
	Monstrous Appearance [4].  The mutant does not have a human seeming, and
	will always be in his composite body.
	
	Variation: Full Expression*- the mutant can split the Ranks of his Powers
	(except this one) among various of the animals in the meld when he is
	'disengaged'.  Thus, one could have Invulnerable ants, Mass-shifted
	cockroaches, or fire-breathing gerbils (yikes!).  If the mutant had three
	Ranks in Invulnerability, for instance, then up to three ants could have
	Rank one Invulnerability, or two could have Rank one and one could have
	Rank two, etc.  If any of these power-toting animals are killed, the
	mutant suffers an immediate wicked backlash (lose Power Charge equal to
	the Power's Rank and take three Health Levels of damage when he reforms)
	and can't use that Power for a week or more.
	
	Note that the largest animal that the mutant might have in a Composite
	Body would be about the size of an armadillo or turtle.  No rotweillers,
	bears, or hippos.  If all of the creatures that make up the mutant's
	body are slain, then he too is slain.
	
	¥ The mutant can control as many as half of the animals in the meld when
	they are separated.  The animals can range as far as two miles from the
	original site and still remain in his control.  In his Composite Body,
	the mutant has one more Health Level.
	¥¥ The mutant can control up to two thirds of the animals in the meld
	when they are separated.  The animals can range as far as ten miles from
	the original site and still remain in his control.  In his Composite
	Body, the mutant has two more Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can control up to three quarters of the animals in the
	meld when they are separated.  The animals can range as far as fifty
	miles from the original site and still remain in his control.  In his
	Composite Body, the mutant has four more Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can control all of the animals in the meld when they are
	separated.  The animals can range as far as three hundred miles from the
	original site and still remain in his control.  In his Composite Body,
	the mutant has six more Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can control all of the animals in the meld when they
	are separated, plus any animal of the appropriate type that is within
	one mile of any animal already in the meld.  The animals remain in his
	control so long as they remain on Earth.  In his Composite Body, the
	mutant has eight more Health Levels.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Partial disengagement - disengage one or two animals in the
	composite, so that you can take advantage of the animals and still pass
	for human.  A missing bat, for instance, might represent one of the
	mutant's ears, while a missing spider wouldn't cause much physical
	distress at all.  The disengaged animals have half of the mutant's dice
	pools for any actions they may wish to attempt-- except for Strength
	pools, for example.  Disengaging larger animals may create deformities
	that will be difficult to explain.  Use of this Stunt requires a
	Stamina Check (diff 6 + one per animal to be separated).
	
Conditional Immortality (Physical) [PN]
	This one's a biggie.  Your mutant cannot die under normal circumstances,
	at least not permanently.  At best, he can be rendered dormant, or killed
	temporarily, but he just keeps coming back.  Bloodscream and Roughhouse
	cannot be slain by mortal weapons, while Candra and Cannonball are both
	Externals.  He probably will not age, but can certainly be beaten up,
	knocked out, given diseases, etc.  There is at least one special set of
	circumstances under which your mutant can breathe his last.  No roll
	is required.
	
	Special Flaw: Unknown Weakness (1-point Flaw)- your mutant does not
	know what sorts of situations he should avoid, since he does not know
	what his special weakness is.
	
	Variation: Immunity- for half cost, the mutant is highly resistant to a
	particular manner of dying.  He might be immune to dying of disease, or
	asphyxiation, or electrocution, or even of any weapon forged, or by
	women.  Everything else, however, will do him in readily.
	
	¥¥¥¥ Your mutant will not die, except for one certain way.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Life Support- your character can buy the Life Support Power with
	Experience points.

Conferral (Physical) [AL]
	This strange meta-power allows a mutant to take one of his Powers that
	is meant to affect himself only (such as Matter Body, Healing Factor,
	etc.) and confer it onto another person.  A flatscan (no powers) can
	not resist; another mutant or other powered species rolls his or her
	Power Potential to resist (diff of the mutant's Rank in this Power
	plus one).  While a Power is conferred, the mutant may not use it
	himself.  In any case, the recipient and the mutant must make a
	successful Stamina check (diff of the Power's Rank) or suffer a
	backlash, and cancel the transfer.  To initiate the transfer, the
	mutant must touch his target.
	
	¥ The mutant may confer one Power to one person; this person may only
	use this Power involuntarily.  For example, a person is transformed by
	the Matter Body Power, and may not transform back until the mutant
	touches him again, canceling the conferral.
	¥¥ The mutant may confer either one Power to two people, or two Powers
	to up to two people.
	¥¥¥ Up to three Powers to up to three people.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to four Powers to up to four people.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to five Powers to up to five people.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Confer Weakness- the mutant may temporarily give away one of his
	Flaws.  This lasts up to a scene.

Confidence Boost* (Mental) [AN]
	Gladiator of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard is the most famous possessor
	of this power, which allows the mutant's own belief in himself to
	fuel his ability to get things done.  Basically, this nasty power
	(which is doubled in cost) gives the mutant extra dice to add to
	EVERY dice pool.  Every single one.  Feats which should be impossible
	for the mutant to perform on paper get done in reality because of
	this power's influence.  On the other hand, whenever the mutant
	fails a roll, he loses all of these dice for the rest of the scene.
	Whenever he BOTCHES a roll, he subtracts these dice from all dice
	pools for the rest of the scene.  Confidence is a two-edged sword.
	This power can never add more dice than the mutant has points of
	temporary Willpower (nor can it subtract more dice).  No roll is
	required.
	
	¥ Add one die to all dice pools.
	¥¥ Two dice.
	¥¥¥ Three dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six dice, one auto-success (or auto-one, if the tables are
	turned)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven dice, one auto-success
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight dice, two auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine dice, two auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten dice, three auto-successes

Cryokinesis (Mental) [AH]
	This ability is related to Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis in that it
	is a mental power that influences the movement of particles.  In
	the case of Cryokinesis, the particles are slowed in their flights.
	It is similar to Energy Emission: Cold, but while that Power uses
	a special energy to slow down molecular movement (and this energy
	can be resisted using Energy Resistance), this Power does the same
	job manually.  Only Cold Resistance or a related Power (like Matter
	Body: Ice) are effective defenses against Cryokinesis.  Like the
	other particle manipulation Powers, Cryokinesis requires heavy
	concentration.  A Perception + Cryokinesis roll is the usual roll.

	¥ One Health Level of cold damage per round can be generated.
	¥¥ One Health Level of damage on the first round, two on each subsequent 
	round.
	¥¥¥ One Health level the first round, two the second round, and three 
	on all subsequent rounds.
	¥¥¥¥ Four damage on the fourth round and those that follow.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five damage on the fifth round and those that follow.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Two damage on the first round, max of six.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Three damage on the first round, max of seven.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Four damage on the first round, max of eight.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Five damage on the first round, max of ten.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Six damage on the first round, no maximum.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Heat Resistance- you may purchase Energy Resistance (Heat) with
	Experience.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Particle Prison- the mutant can hold particles virtually still,
	turning even gases into solids as long as he concentrates, perhaps
	imprisoning a person within a matrix of 'frozen' molecules.

Crystallization (Social) [AH]
	The mutant who has this Power can rearrange the molecular bonds of
	normal substances into a crystal lattice.  Thus, carbon can become
	diamond (crystalline carbon) and a living target can become a living
	(albeit immobile) crystal.  The size and shape of the target may
	change somewhat in the process of crystallization, though these traits
	return to normal if the process is reversed.  This crystal is much
	harder (usually) than the normal substance, though it is not
	necessarily more resilient.  If the structure is shattered, the
	transformation may (at the ST's option) become permanent. The mutant
	must touch the target to crystallize it, and then roll Crystallization,
	difficulty 7.  This can be soaked by living targets.
	
	¥ Two damage successes required to damage structure (does full
	damage in that case- any less is ignored completely).  Structure
	rearranges itself into normal configuration in 3 rounds.
	¥¥ Four successes required.  Time limit of 10 rounds.
	¥¥¥ Six successes required.  Lasts one scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight successes required.  Lasts one day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten successes required.  Lasts one week.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Structures have two Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Structures have three Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Four Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Six Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten Stamina.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Ice Bridge- by crystallizing the water molecules in the air, the
	mutant can create pseudo-ice structures that will not melt with the
	application of normal heat.  The structure can only bear a weight of
	30 pounds per square inch, so be careful!
	¥¥¥ Cold Storage- the mutant can use a crystallized creature as fuel
	for any Power that requires life force.

Cybergrafting (Physical) [AL]
	This Power allows a mutant to make cybernetic enhancements to himself
	without the medical and technical knowledge that such a feat normally
	requires.  It does not allow him to make the implants, only connect
	them.  Of course, the connection of some devices is a more challenging
	feat than others, and this is reflected in the difficulty of the
	Dexterity + Cybergrafting roll (typically diff 6).  Installing a simple
	prosthesis would be a difficulty 5 roll, while installing a new skeleton
	would be difficulty 8, and installing a computer that can access memories
	and works on brain impulses would be difficulty 10.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant can graft cybernetic devices to himself.

Cybermimicry* (Physical) [AL]
	A mutant with this Power can alter his own body in such a way that it
	can perform any electromechanical function that he can understand.  For
	example, he can try to turn his hand into a pistol, or his skin and
	muscles into an exoskeleton (armour).  Naturally, the mutant cannot
	duplicate effects (especially damaging effects) or duplicate a Power
	greater than his Rank in this Power.  So, a Rank one weapon can only
	inflict Strength + 2 damage (or in the case of a pistol, a base of
	2 damage) as per the Body Weaponry Power, or up to two Health Levels of
	energy damage, as per the Energy Emission Power.  Duplicating the
	effects of a double-cost Power requires double the normal Rank in this
	Power.  A Stamina + Cybermimicry roll (difficulty 7) is required to
	make any change- a botch may inflict up to one Health Level of damage to
	the mutant per Rank.  Note that this Power is only as effective as the
	mutant's ratings in Science and Technology.  Parts that have been
	transformed into a cybernetic part do not heal normally if they take
	damage -- assume that one Health Level per device cannot be healed
	until the mutant resumes a normal form.  All changes made by this
	Power are permanent, but reversible.
	
	¥ The mutant can duplicate Rank one electromechanical effects
	¥¥ Rank two
	¥¥¥ Rank three
	¥¥¥¥ Rank four
	¥¥¥¥¥ Rank five
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Rank six
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Rank seven
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Rank eight
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Rank nine
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Rank ten
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Reversion- the mutant can change devices back to their original
	body part sources as a free action (no roll required).
	¥¥¥/¥ Healing (Cybermimicry/T.O. Body Parts Stunt)- cybernetic parts
	that have been transformed from a techno-organic part heal normally.
	¥¥¥¥ Repair- the mutant can attempt to re-mimic a part (Stamina +
	Cybermimicry, difficulty 7 + the Health Level loss associated with the
	affected part-- minimum of 8) in order to bring it back into working
	order.  Each success heals one Health Level of damage associated with
	damage to the cybernetic part.

Cyclonic Spin (Physical) [AL]
	Like the Red Tornado or Riptide of the Marauders, a mutant with this
	Power can spin his body (either at the neck, the shoulder, the wrist,
	or the waist- typically at the mutant's option) at terrific speeds.
	A mutant with this Power cannot get a broken neck in the normal way.
	This can be used in a variety of ways.  It dampens the power of any
	material attacks that must pass through the wind storm that this Power
	generates, it allows the mutant to hover and move in that way at
	great speeds, it protects him from wind or vibration attacks, and
	can even be used to fling small objects at great speeds (as Riptide
	is fond of doing).  No roll is required to use this Power normally,
	but a Stamina + Cyclone or Dex + Cyclone roll may be required in certain
	circumstances.
	
	¥ The mutant can add his Power Rank to his soak dice against any
	material attack that passes through the wind storm and subtracts
	that Rank from wind or vibration attacks.  It allows the mutant to
	parry fire or plasma effects, and will protect against them completely
	if the parry is successful.  The mutant may add his Power Rank to
	the damage pool of any missile flung through the cyclone, and the
	mutant can move at a rate of 25 miles per hour when hovering.
	¥¥ All of the above, except the mutant can move at a rate of 50 miles
	per hour.
	¥¥¥ All of the above, except the mutant moves at 75 mph.
	¥¥¥¥ All of the above, except the mutant moves at 100 mph.
	¥¥¥¥¥ All of the above, except the mutant moves at 125 mph.

Cyphering (Mental) [AN]
	Cyphering is the ability to intuitively understand any language or
	code, which makes a mutant who has it a natural linguistic genius and
	a potential computer genius.  Douglas Ramsey (Cypher) of the New 
	Mutants had this Power.  While it may not be much in combat situations, 
	it is a very useful ability.  The Power also makes it much easier to 
	learn a language permanently.  No roll is normally required, but on
	occasion an Intelligence + Cyphering or a Perception + Cyphering might
	be called for.

	¥ The mutant intuitively understands all languages and codes, reading
	and understanding them as if they were in his native tongue.  So long
	as he has a sample of the language in front of him, he can speak or
	write in it.  Of course, if there are anatomical considerations (e.g.
	an alien language requires that its speakers have three mouths and
	an air bladder) then this Power does not obviate those obstacles.
	The Computer and Linguistics knowledges may be purchased with Freebie
	points at a rate of one point per dot, or with Experience points at
	a rate of 1 x current.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Hyper-Linguistics- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hyper-
	Linguistics with Experience points.
	¥ New Language- with a successful Intelligence + Cyphering roll (diff
	12 - her Rank in Linguistics) the mutant may spontaneously create a
	language that only she (and other mutants with this Power) could know.

Death Force Absorption and Conversion (Social) [AN]
	Not the sort of Power that you bring home to mother.  The ability to
	absorb and use those energies that are released when someone (or
	something) dies is not socially acceptable, and can lead to all sorts
	of nasty things being said about you.  The mutant Threnody and the
	strange Deathtoll both have (had?) this Power.  This Power can be used
	as a weapon against the undead (roll Death Force every round for damage;
	soakable, but healed as Aggravated).  A Stamina + Death A/C roll
	(difficulty of the victim's Willpower) is required.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Appearance- as the Power: Physical Imitation, with a Rank equal to the
	Rank of this Power.  The Imitation lasts as long as desired, but once
	abandoned, cannot be re-established.
	* Energy Conversion- if the mutant has an energy emission Power, he can
	add an automatic damage success for Health Level that the dying person
	had in life.  Otherwise, the mutant can choose to release the energy
	(of whatever form, see the Energy List), which has one die in its damage
	pool for every Health Level that the victim had in life.
	* Health Conversion- the mutant is fully healed every time someone in
	his vicinity dies.
	* Life for a Life- Deathtoll had this disgusting variation, which allows
	the mutant to 'absorb' and store any number of lives, and then use them
	to keep going whenever he dies.  When a life is spent, the mutant is
	fully healed, recharged with Rage, Willpower, etc.  He is not retrieved
	from the situation that he is in, however, and may die again immediately.
	The mutant must purchase the 'Store Energy' stunt in order to take this
	variation.
	* Knowledge- the mutant absorbs the Abilities and memories of the dying
	person.  This knowledge lasts one day per Rank.
	* Power*- the mutant absorbs the Powers of the dying person.  Only one
	person can be mimicked in this way at a time.  No Power Stunts are
	stolen.  These powers last one day per Rank.  This variation costs
	double.
	
	¥ The mutant must be touching the dying person to absorb the power.
	¥¥ The mutant must be touching the dying person, or have inflicted
	the death-blow and be within line of sight to absorb the power.
	¥¥¥ The mutant must be within ten feet of the dying person.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be within line of sight or have inflicted the
	death-blow to absorb the power.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be within a mile to absorb the power.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- if the mutant has an appropriate variation, she can
	store the energies released on death for later use.
	¥¥¥ Pain Absorption- the mutant can purchase the Power: Pain Absorption
	and Conversion with Experience, even if she did not start the game with
	this Power.
	¥¥¥¥ Life Force Absorption- the mutant can purchase the Power: Life
	Force Absorption and Conversion with Experience, even if she did not
	start the game with this Power.

Decentralized Identity* (Physical) [PN]
	Curiously, the mutant's body lacks much specialization, particularly in
	internal organs.  He lacks a separate digestive system, circulatory
	system, and even nervous system.  In fact, any portion of his body is
	capable of carrying on the functions of the entire body, at least to a
	point.  The exception to this is the sensory organs.  In any case, this 
	Power makes the mutant very hard to kill.  All lethal damage is treated
	as bashing damage.
	
	Aggravated damage, such as that caused by fire, acid, or other denaturing
	agents, will cause greater damage to the mutant than mere lethal damage.
	The mutant's upper body could be severed from his legs; in that case, the
	larger piece will become active, and the other piece will be considered
	dead.  The larger piece would carry on as normal, albeit with the problems
	engendered by not having as many limbs.
	
	If the last Health Level of damage (the killing level) that the mutant
	takes is aggravated, the body is too damaged to carry on, and the mutant
	is dead.
	
	Variation: My Buddy- if the mutant loses a body part that is at least
	10 percent of the size of his total body, it becomes a separate,
	biologically viable entity.  It is in no way under the control of the
	mutant, and may well develop a distinctive personality.  It must heal
	as normal.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant's body is as homogeneous as silly putty.  No roll is
	required in the normal case; if one were ever needed, it would probably
	be Stamina + DI.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Decentralized Mind- since the mutant's mind does not reside in any
	particular part of his body, he may use his Stamina to "soak" mind-
	affecting attacks such as Telepathy.
	¥¥¥ Life Support- the mutant may purchase the Power: Life Support with
	Experience.
	¥¥¥ Odd Body- the mutant may add his Stamina as the number of extra
	successes required to affect him with Biomanipulation.
	¥¥¥ Regeneration- although the mutant heals at a normal rate, he can
	regenerate lost limbs and other body parts.  Each such part must be
	healed before a Health Level can be recovered (i.e., the body must be
	whole before other healing takes place), which means that the mutant
	could be out of business for a long time in case of a messy accident.

Dependency Inducement (Social) [AL]
	A Power both insidious and severe, Dependency Inducement will trigger a
	physical or mental reliance upon a certain stimulus in its victims; it
	short, it instills addiction.  This addiction will seem at first to have
	positive effects, but in the long run, it may lead to the victim's
	ruin.  In order to induce a dependency on a particular stimulus, the
	intended victim must be in contact with that stimulus when the Power is
	triggered.  The result is a contested roll between the victim's
	Willpower and the mutant's Charisma + Dependency Inducement, both rolls
	difficulty six.  If the victim wins, no addiction is accrued. If the
	mutant wins, then the victim forms a dependency on the stimulus.  A tie
	favours the victim.  The effects of the addiction depend upon the
	number of successes by which the mutant wins:
	
	One success: the victim receives a bonus of one die to all actions
	while/after receiving the stimulus.  This bonus will recur for the
	next three scenes in which the stimulus is induced.  The stimulus
	feels very pleasant.
	
	Two successes: the victim receives a bonus of one die to all actions
	and one point of temporary Willpower.  This bonus will recur for the
	next three exposures.
	
	Three successes: the victim receives a bonus of two dice to all
	actions and one point of temporary Willpower.  This bonus will recur
	for the next four exposures.
	
	Four successes: the victim receives a bonus of two dice to all
	actions, one point of temporary Willpower, and a point of Stamina that
	lasts for the rest of the scene.  This bonus will recur for the next
	four exposures.
	
	Five or more successes: the victim receives a bonus of two dice to all
	actions, recharges his Willpower, and receives a point of Strength and
	a point of Stamina that lasts for the rest of the scene.  This bonus
	will recur for the next five exposures.
	
	After the exposure bonus limit is reached, the victim must keep in
	essentially constant contact with the stimulus in order to receive the
	bonus.  The bonus will last for as long as a round after the stimulus
	is received, and then fade away.  The victim may have to use ever-
	larger doses of the stimulus to receive the bonus.
	
	Worse yet, the victim begins to take penalties if he does not get
	regular 'hits' of the stimulus.  If the victim goes for longer than a
	day without the stimulus, he suffers from sharp pains and a general
	dulling of all faculties.  He suffers a -1 penalty to all actions per
	success that the mutant achieved against him.
	
	If the victim continues to take 'hits' of the stimulus, he will begin
	to suffer from a decaying gratification curve.  After ten weeks, less
	the number of successes the mutant achieved, he will receive a pleasant
	buzz from the substance, but no more bonuses.  The substance will
	merely negate the penalties, and typically for no more than an hour. 
	After an hour, the penalties begin to accumulate at a rate of -1 per
	hour until the maximum dictated by the initial roll is reached. 
	
	It is possible to suffer through the withdrawal symptoms and free
	oneself of the dependency, but this is harder if the victim has been
	addicted for a long time.  The withdrawal symptoms will start at their
	maximum values and decline by one point per week.  Unfortunately, for
	every week that the victim has spent in addiction, his maximum
	temporary Willpower for purposes of resisting the stimulus if
	proffered will be decreased by one.  It is possible to reach zero
	Willpower in this way.
	
	¥ The mutant can induce a dependency on some relatively rare substance
	that already has an addictive quality (like cocaine, alcohol, or
	morphine)
	¥¥ The mutant can induce a dependency on a more common substance (such
	as caffeine or beef) that does not necessarily, in itself, have any
	deleterious or addictive qualities.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can induce a dependency on activities that produce
	marked chemical responses in the body- such as an addiction to sexual
	activity (endorphins) or danger (adrenaline).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can induce a dependency on activities that produce
	more subtle chemical responses in the body- such as an addiction to
	eating, or heavy exercise, or use of a particular Power.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can induce a dependency on activities that have an
	active and deleterious effect on the body- such as an addiction to
	pain.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Remove addiction- the mutant can choose to remove a chemical or
	psychological addiction that would be rated one Rank lower than his
	current.  Thus, at Rank ¥¥, she could cure addictions to rare
	substances, or heroin, cocaine, and the like (as Rank ¥).
	
Detection (Physical/Mental) [AL or PL]
	There are as many forms of detection as there are things to be
	detected.  Basically, this is the ability to either perceive things
	without regard to the senses, or to distinguish otherwise obscure
	classes of things.  The list of possible detection powers follows;
	those marked with an (a) are Abilities that do not need to be
	ruled by the Power Ranks once the first (and only) Rank is bought.
	Those marked with an (m) are Mental only.  Usually a Perception + 
	Alertness is the only roll required.  
	
	Awareness (a)
	Danger Sense
	Energy
	Falsehood
	Illusion
	Intuition (a)
	Life
	Mutant
	Magic
	Psi Talent (m)
	Quintessence
	Spirits
	Telelocation (m)
	Telepathic Invasion (m)
	
	¥ The mutant can detect or perceive the stimulus when in visual range.
	Falsehood and Telepathic Invasion are limited to visual range or less,
	and cannot be improved beyond this level.  The source is determinable
	with a successful Perception + Detection roll.
	¥¥ A distance of up to a mile is possible; the approximate distance
	and direction is known with a successful Perception + Detection roll
	¥¥¥ A distance of up to 50 miles is possible.
	¥¥¥¥ A distance of 1000 miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on the planet.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere in the solar system.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in the galaxy.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Anywhere in the universe.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Anywhere in other dimensions.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Anytime, anywhere.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥/¥ Quickening of the Blood- Danger Sense/Rage Power Stunt.  The
	mutant collects a point of Rage whenever he detects danger.
	¥/¥¥ Zero Hour- Danger Sense/Accelerated Recovery Stunt.  The first
	time in a scene that the mutant detects personal danger, Accelerated
	Recovery is triggered as if a full hour had passed.
	¥¥/¥ Far Speech- Telelocation/Telepathy Stunt.  The mutant may use
	Telepathic abilities on anyone locatable with Telelocation.

Diabolic Aura (Social) [AN]
	Where'd we get this one?  A mystical aura surrounds your mutant,
	offering its benefits to him and other friendly persons within a
	certain radius. There are a variety of different auras; each has a
	slightly different appearance, but all of them are variations on a
	soft, pale-coloured glow.  The mutant may select one at character
	creation.  Activating the aura requires the expenditure of a point of
	Willpower; it lasts for the rest of the scene or until he shuts it off
	deliberately.  The mutant chooses one type of Aura when this Power is
	taken, as follows:
	
	* Celerity- all recipients receive one automatic initiative success per
	Rank.
	* Confusion- enemies subtract one die per Rank from all high-
	concentration Power dice pools.
	* Distortion- the auras surrounding the recipients are strange and
	warped; all missile attacks (including firearms) made by enemies
	against them subtract one from their dice pools per Rank.
	* Energy Protection- all recipients soak energy attacks at -2
	difficulty.
	* Healing- all recipients recover one Health Level of bashing or lethal
	damage per round.
	* Holy Fire- all recipients inflict two dice of fire damage as a result
	of any successful melee, brawling, firearms, or missile attack (not
	energy attacks).
	* Power- all recipients have one extra die in their hand-to-hand damage
	dice pools per Rank.
	* Quiet- sound is dampened at the edges of the aura; all Stealth
	difficulties for friendlies are reduced by two, and all hearing-
	related Perception difficulties for enemies within the field are
	increased by two.
	* Reflection- enemies must soak half of all damage they inflict on
	recipients.  The kind of damage is taken into consideration (fire
	damage is absorbed by energy resistance, etc).
	* Travel- all recipients move at the foot speed of the fastest friendly
	affected by the aura (whether she simply has a higher Dexterity, or
	Hyper-Speed).  This applies to movement _only_.
	* Vigor- all recipients lose one less die per Rank to Health-related
	dice penalties.
	
	Note that this Power is both magical and empathic in nature (since it
	distinguishes between friends, neutrals, and foes).  If the mutant
	becomes incapable of distinguishing friend from foe, things could get
	ugly...
	
	¥ The mutant always receives the benefit of the aura; in addition,
	all 'friendlies' within 10 feet also get aura-charged.
	¥¥ The range is 20 feet.
	¥¥¥ 10 metres.
	¥¥¥¥ 30 metres.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 100 metres.

Digestive Adaption (Physical) [AN]
	If your mutant can get it into her stomach, she can digest it.  Toxic
	waste, old shoes, bolts, the Beast's casseroles, you name it.  Of
	course, this Power doesn't improve the tastes of things.  No roll is
	required to activate this Power.  There are a few implications to this 
	Power:
	
	* As long as you've got something to stuff into your mouth, you
	won't starve.
	* Food with minimal nutritional value becomes as good for you as
	the best health food.
	* Ingested poisons will do you no harm whatsoever.
	
	¥¥ Digest just about anything.  Bon apetit!
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Bio-Resistance- requires the Stunt: Foreign Body Protection.
	The mutant gets three dice to 'soak' Biomanipulation effects.
	¥¥ Foreign Body Protection*- the mutant's body will transform any
	poison, bacterium, or other pollutant introduced into it by any
	means (injection, etc.) into harmless substances with the
	expenditure of a Willpower point.
	¥¥ Hyper-Digestion- the mutant can digest a normal meal in only a
	few seconds.  More intractable materials require a few minutes to
	an hour.

Dimension Shifting* (Physical) [AL]
	This is not the ability to move across the dimensional barriers to 
	the Negative Zone; rather, this is the ability to perceive the world 
	in 1, 2, or 4 dimensions, rather than the usual, boring, three. At 
	higher Ranks,  the mutant is actually able to move in those dimensions, 
	slipping sideways into what most people understand only as an abstract 
	concept. The Quiet Men in the Wildstorm universe have this ability.  
	The mutant must spend a point of Willpower to activate this Power.
	The roll is usually Perception + Dimension Shifting (difficulty 7),
	to see into another dimension, and Stamina + Dimension Shifting
	(difficulty 7) to move in another dimension.

	¥ The mutant can 'see' in one, two, or three dimensions. This does not 
	affect her material disposition. Movement is impossible while the
	mutant is perceiving one or two dimensional 'space'.
	¥¥ The mutant can 'shift' down into two dimensions, or perceive the 
	world in four free dimensions.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can 'shift' down into one or two dimensions.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can 'shift' down into the fourth dimension and move in 
	it freely (instead of in a straight line).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can 'shift' down into zero dimensional space- what is 
	known to mages as the 'correspondence point'. It touches all places in
	the universe and none of them.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can move and perceive in two dimensional sets at the 
	same time. Yikes. This requires a Wits check (diff 9) to avoid being 
	overwhelmed by sensory data.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Nexus Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Power: Energy
	Resistance (Nexus) with Experience points.
	¥¥ Life Line- by shifting her sight into four dimensions, the mutant 
	can roughly perceive when the target creature was born, and how much 
	time it has left to it. Time traveling targets muddy this perception.
	¥¥ Talk & Walk- the mutant can move through one set of dimensional 
	laws and perceive via another set at the same time.
	¥¥¥¥ Time Walk- the mutant can decide to walk freely about in time,
	heading backwards, etc. if desired. There is no practical limit to the
	distance that the mutant can go, but it takes a while (sort of). 
	Normal walking speed constitutes a normal rate of movement through
	time- the mutant will be keeping pace with everyone else. A sprint
	allows the mutant to move faster. The mutant may also stop moving-
	effectively freezing time- but this also prevents him from taking any
	effective physical action.  Yes, this ability is much more powerful
	when combined with hyper-speed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Streaming- this Stunt allows the mutant to perceive from one 
	dimensional set via another.  This is usually employed with three 
	dimensional space and zero-dimensional space, effectively allowing
	the mutant to see anywhere.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Teleportation- the mutant can shift down to zero-dimensional
	'space' and then rebuild himself in three dimensions- somewhere else.
	This does not require the Power Stunt: Talk & Walk, but it will be a
	random teleport without it. The range is effectively unlimited.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Time Jumping- the mutant can 'jump' across time by moving
	through four dimensional space and zero dimensional space concurrently.
	This does not require the Power Stunt: Talk & Walk since the mutant can
	also perceive both dimensional sets.  The range is effectively
	unlimited.

Dimensional Attack Portals (Social) [AL]
	This Power allows the mutant to open a one-way portal into a really
	nasty location.  This portal will not allow anything from the mutant's
	side to enter, but will instead eject things from the other side.
	In despite of the name, portals do not have to be cross-dimensional
	to open.  For example, a portal could be opened to the photosphere
	of the sun, releasing nasty plasma at the victims of the attack.  It
	could be opened to the atmosphere of Jupiter, releasing ammonia gas
	and other nasty poisons.  It could be opened to a dimension of 
	Hades, letting out all kinds of bad stuff.  Note that no sentient
	being can pass through one of these portals.  The Rank of the Power
	determines the size of the portal (and thus the damage that can be
	inflicted); portals usually remain open for about a half-second
	regardless of size.  The system for opening a portal is Charisma +
	DAP (diff 7).  The portal will appear anywhere within line of sight
	or fifty feet, whichever is less.
	
	¥ Up to two Health Levels of damage may be inflicted.
	¥¥ Three Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Up to five Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to six Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to eight Health Levels.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Up to nine Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Up to eleven Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Up to twelve Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Up to fourteen Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to fifteen Health Levels.

Disease Carrier (Physical) [PL]
	As the mutant Infectia showed, the power to spread disease is not one
	to be trifled with.  The mutant has immunity to most diseases, and can
	pick them up and spread them in novel ways- making mononucleosis an
	air-borne disease, for instance- and can speed up or slow down the
	effects of diseases in others.  Symptoms may crop up right away if a
	mutant with this power is around.  To spread a disease around, roll
	your Manipulation + Disease Carrier (difficulty of the victim's
	Stamina + Athletics).
	
	¥ Minor, irritating diseases (the cold, headaches, the measles, etc.)
	¥¥ Minor debilitating diseases (influenza, mono, smallpox, etc.)
	¥¥¥ Serious debilitating diseases (dysentery, cholera, polio, etc.)
	¥¥¥¥ Severe diseases (leprosy, meningitis, cancer, AIDS, etc.)
	¥¥¥¥¥ Vile diseases (Ebola, bubonic plague, etc.)
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Really vile diseases (pneumonic plague, etc.)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Truly nasty diseases (Legacy virus, techno-organic virus)
	
	
	The effects of each disease are up to the Storyteller.  The Disease
	Carrier is immune to diseases up to and including those that can be
	spread via her Power Rank.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Speed process- the onset of symptoms can be made instant on a good
	Charisma + Disease Carrier roll (diff 8).
	¥ Slow process- the mutant can slow down the onset of symptoms for
	as long as light concentration is maintained.  This is a Charisma +
	Disease Carrier roll (diff 5).
	¥¥ Suppress- the mutant can render herself non-infectious for as
	long as light concentration is maintained.  (Charisma + Carrier,
	diff 5).
	¥¥¥ Alter Disease- the mutant can change the way that the disease
	is contracted, making it easier or more difficult to catch.
	(Manipulation + Carrier, diff 9).
	¥¥¥ Curative- the mutant can cure any disease up to one Rank lower
	than her Rank in this power.  Thus, a mutant with ¥¥¥ Disease Carrier
	can cure the flu on a successful Intelligence + Disease Carrier roll 
	(diff 10 - the victim's Stamina), but not cholera, which she can 
	spread. 
	¥¥¥ Purge- the mutant can 'remove' any disease from her repertoire,
	since people can catch them from her normally if she isn't paying
	attention.  Diseases of higher Rank than her Power Rank cannot be
	purged in this way.  No roll required.

Dispersion (Physical) [AH]
	Similar in some ways to Mass-Shifting (Decrease), this Power causes the
	mutant's molecules to disperse into a coherent cloud, which he can still
	move with all the force of their normal association; that is, each
	particle moves as though it had the mutant's full strength behind it!
	The particles can therefore pass through many solid objects, through
	the gaps between the particles that make up those substances.  Use of
	this Power requires heavy concentration, and a Stamina + Dispersion
	roll (diff 6) to activate.  Reforming can be difficult if the mutant
	has dispersed himself to far, but the base difficulty is 6, using the
	same system.  The Flash has a weak version of this Power.
	
	¥ The mutant looks almost exactly the same (it would be difficult for
	most people to describe the difference), but he is in a state of
	dispersion, and can pass slowly through solid objects as dense as
	iron, or allow solid objects to pass through him.  He has no more (or
	less) resistant to energy attacks than usual, but he is in no danger
	of being further dispersed by magnetic attacks.
	¥¥ The mutant can expand his 'body' to eight times its usual volume,
	which makes him look like a billowing, coloured cloud, and allows him
	to pass through objects as dense as lead.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can disperse his 'body' to twenty-seven times its usual
	volume, which now resembles a cloud of tiny bugs, or perhaps a small
	bank of fog.  He can pass through objects as dense as plutonium.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can disperse his 'body' to sixty-four times its
	usual volume, which is very difficult to see (+2 to all Perception
	difficulties associated with seeing him).  The mutant can take a
	maximum amount of damage from any one energy attack equal to half of
	his total Health.  He can pass through objects as dense as omnium.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can disperse to 125 times his usual volume, which
	renders him practically invisible (Perception check at +3 diff
	required even to notice his presence, let alone target him).  He
	can pass through objects as dense as carbonadium or vibranium.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can disperse to 216 times his usual volume,
	which makes him invisible except to those with Powers like Material
	Sense, Karma Perception, etc.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Partial Dispersion- the mutant may elect to disperse discreet
	body parts (electing to disperse only a hand, or only the head),
	which requires a Dexterity + Dispersion (diff 8).
	¥¥¥¥ Time Bombs- By vibrating his molecules violently as he passes
	through an object, he can set it to explode the following round,
	inflicting half of its own Health Levels in damage to the surrounding
	area.  The mutant must roll Strength + Dispersion (diff 6) to do
	this, and must get more successes than the object has Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ghost in the Shell- requires the Stunt: Partial Dispersion.  
	You can disperse your interior to the point of near-invisibility,
	passing it outside your skin or 'shell', which itself remains the
	regular shape and size, appearing quite solid.  Strength, Dexterity,
	and Perception rolls are all increased in difficulty by 4-- if this
	brings the difficulty of an action above 10, it can not be performed.
	Requires an Appearance + Dispersion (diff 9, with each success making
	the 'shell' appear more solid and realistic).

Disruption Field (Physical) [AL]
	Like one half of the fabulous Bedlam Brothers, a mutant with this Power
	can interrupt the normal operations of any electronic device within
	the area of effect.  Of course, it is possible to shield such devices
	magnetically from any such interference (the SHIELD helicarrier is
	protected in this way) but most devices have no such protection.  A
	cyborg who is affected by this Power will have built-in reboot functions
	that will restart the affected parts when the mutant is out of range,
	but most scrambled devices do not have this feature.  Note that the
	human neural system is not affected by this Power.  To erect the field
	requires a Manipulation + Disruption Field roll (diff 6) - it lasts
	until dispelled voluntarily or until the mutant loses consciousness.
	
	¥ The range of this Power is touch.
	¥¥ Five feet.
	¥¥¥ Ten feet.
	¥¥¥¥ Twenty feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Fifty feet.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ One hundred feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Three hundred feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ One thousand feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ One mile.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty miles.

Distortion Beam (Social) [AL]
	A beam of pure probability flux composes this Power (which requires a
	Dex + Directed Blast, difficulty varies with range and target
	movement) which is a more elemental form of the Hex Power.  It
	automatically disrupts magic or probability manipulation on contact,
	as well as any effect that dampens magic or probability manipulation. 
	Any normal being (like a human or mutant, for instance, or even an
	object which tends to have the same shape over time) suffers pattern
	fraying and thus damage whenever it is struck by this beam.  An object
	that loses its last health level as a result of being struck by a
	distortion beam ceases to exist.
	
	¥ Two dice of damage can be inflicted.
	¥¥ Four dice of damage.
	¥¥¥ Six damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten damage.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ One auto-damage success.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Two auto successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Three auto successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Four auto successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Five auto successes.

Domina Power** (Social/Mental) [AL]
	A common Power among the Neo that allows the leader of a particular
	tribe to draw upon the power suites of her companions.  There are two
	levels to this Power; Domina and Client.  The Client level (Rank one)
	merely allows the mutant to be a donor.  The Domina level (Rank four)
	allows the mutant to draw from her Clients.  Note that the Client
	level does NOT disqualify the mutant from getting other Powers; the
	Domina level IS double cost, and the mutant may only develop
	Mega-Attributes, Hyper-Abilities, and perhaps Extra Health Levels (if
	the mutant is a Physical character) or Iron Will (if the mutant is a
	Mental character). This Power can be improved with Experience, but the
	original Domina of a group must die or lose her abilities before a new
	Domina can take her place.  Note that a Domina can only draw from her
	clients, not the clients of another Domina.

	Most of the time, a Domina draws upon the Powers of her group when
	they are incapacitated, or far from danger.  It is easier to do so if
	they are willing or unconscious (a simple Stamina check, difficulty of
	the highest Power rank, is all that is required.  Failure results in
	feedback as per the Power: Power Manipulation Backlash.  If the client
	is reluctant to share his Powers, they must make a contested Willpower
	check (diff of the opposing character's Power Potential).  The loser
	receives feedback as above.  If the Domina wins, she gets the client's
	Powers (after making the obligatory Stamina check).  If the client
	wins, his Powers are not drawn.

	All Powers, active and passive, are eligible to be drawn.  The Domina
	may draw up to her rating in Stamina in different Powers at any one
	time.  She may pick and choose one or two Powers at a time from single
	or multiple clients, if she desires, but she decides at the time that
	she draws them which Powers she is to take.  Another drawing requires
	another Stamina check (and possibly another contest of wills).

	While a client's Powers are being drawn, he loses the use of any
	active Powers that the Domina has seen fit to draw, keeping only the
	passive ones (and those at a Rank lower than usual, if possible).  If
	the Domina chose not to take a particular Power, then the mutant may
	use it as usual.
	
	The Domina may shed the Powers of any particular mutant at any time,
	but she must shed ALL of that mutant's Powers at the same time, not
	just one or two.  The Client may also try to wrest back his Powers,
	which will require another contested Willpower check as above. Success
	requires a Stamina check as above, except that both parties must make
	this check.  Note that this attack will take one of the Domina's
	actions to contest, and will increase her difficulties for all other
	maneuvers that round by one (if she just lets the Powers go, not
	taking an action), or two (if she contests it) in any case.

	Note also that the Domina draws the Powers at the Rank that their
	Client has them in, or at her Actual Power Level, whichever is less.
	If the Power has a minimum Rank that is higher than her APL, she
	can not draw that Power.
	
	If a mutant buys the Domina level of this Power with Experience,
	all of her other Powers (except those that she would normally be
	eligible for, as above) will go dormant.
	
	¥ Client level; the mutant may donate her Powers to her Domina.
	¥¥¥¥ Domina level; the mutant may draw Powers from her clients.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Accept Servitude- the Domina may accept the pledge of another
	client.  This is a very draining process (requiring the expenditure
	of at least 5 points of Willpower from the Domina and three points
	from the client).
	¥¥¥¥ Ping- the Domina may send a tiny 'pulse' along the link between
	herself and a client, immediately catching the client's attention
	and revealing the approximate location of the client to the Domina.

Dream Manipulation (Mental) [AH]
	Dreams are strange things which seem little prone to logic or conscious
	direction.  At least this is true to those who do not possess this
	Power.  Dream Manipulation is a pretty self explanatory power, as it
	allows the wielder to do exactly what its name implies.  At first
	wielders of this power are able to effect their own dreams only, but as
	they grow in skill and ability they begin to learn to harness the dreams
	of others, both waking and sleeping.  The normal usage of this Power
	requires a Manipulation + Dream Manipulation roll (diff 6 to affect self, 
	difficulty to affect others is target's Willpower). In order to affect the 
	dreams of another person, the mutant needs to be within 200 feet of the 
	intended target. Mutants who wield this Power may purchase the Dream 
	background with freebie or experience points.

	The foundation of this Power is a dimension known as the Dreamscape, a
	grey, and largely featureless area similar to the Umbra that is created
	by the collective unconscious of all sentient minds.  All dreamers have
	their sleeping dramas played out for them on the Dreamscape, which
	forges objects and people according to the requirements of the
	unconscious mind.  A mutant with Dream Manipulation can consciously and
	deliberately influence the Dreamscape, bending it to his will.

	Special Flaw: Dreamless (2 point Flaw) For some reason the mutant's
	possession of this ability has robbed her of her own ability to dream. 
	For her, sleeping is merely the closing of eyes, and then opening them
	again several hours later. While this is restful, it does not always
	feel that way, so a mutant with this flaw is often likely to feel
	lethargic during the day (Willpower roll diff 6 or suffer from a -1 to
	all dice pools for the day due to extreme lethargy). In addition, since
	the poor soul is unable to dream while sleeping, she is more susceptible
	to the effects of illusion casting and hallucination inducing powers and
	abilities (anyone attempting to affect a mutant who suffers this flaw
	with either type of power has -2 to his normal difficulty).

	¥ At this level, the mutant is only capable of manipulating the imagery
	of his own dreams, for example, turning a nightmare into something more
	pleasant, or turning the dream image of his frumpy old 3rd grade teacher
	into Ms. Universe.
	¥¥ The mutant is now capable of creating dreams for himself as long as
	he is aware that he is dreaming.  He may use this as a form of
	meditation or problem solving- he may recover one point of Willpower or
	Gnosis per success on a Perception + Dream Manipulation roll (diff 8)
	each time he does this.  In addition, the mutant can begin to affect the
	dreams of others in minor ways (i.e., imagery), though it is difficult
	(diff is target's willpower +1).
	¥¥¥ At this level a mutant has total control over her own dreams, down
	to each last detail. More control can also be had over the dreams of
	others, allowing minute details to be altered and manipulated, although
	not totally changed or crafted completely from scratch.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant now controls his own dreams to such a degree that
	constant manipulation or creation is not required (rolls are no longer
	needed to affect self).  Any detail of another person's dream can be
	totally manipulated, and new elements or even a totally new dream
	crafted.  The mutant can actually cause real physical damage (in the
	form of bashing damage) to accrue to dreamers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ At this level dreams are the plaything of the mutant, for both
	himself and others. His dreams have become so potent that they may
	catch up others who are sleeping within 100 feet of him (A Willpower
	roll diff 7 can be made to resist this). He may now try to visit dreams
	upon others that are so frightening, or so pleasant, that they leave the
	recipient feeling either perfectly rested, or horribly drained when they
	next awake (A willpower roll diff 7 may be made to try and fight off the
	effects of this type of nightmare).  Penalties of -1 accrue for each day
	of this treatment (cumulative to -5, total physical exhaustion).  Real
	(that is, lethal) damage can accrue to dreamers.

	Sample Power Stunts
	¥ Dream Awareness: This stunt allows gives its wielder the ability to
	recognize that she is having a dream, and gives her conscious awareness
	of her surroundings and goings on.
	¥ Dream Recall: This Stunt allows the mutant to perfectly recall any
	and all dreams she experienced during the night upon waking.
	¥ Perceive Eris- the mutant can recognize faeries on a successful
	Perception + Dream Travel roll (diff 6).
	¥¥ Dream Warrior- the mutant can forge himself weapons and armour in
	his dreams (each success on a Stamina + Dream Travel roll gives one
	Rank in Body Armour or Body Weaponry) to protect himself.
	¥¥¥ Sleep Suggestion: A mutant with this stunt is capable of burying a
	suggestion inside some element of a dream, as long as it is not life
	threatening, or something akin to asking them to cut off their own arm
	(requires a Dream Creation/Manipulation roll diff target's willpower
	+2). If successful, then the target of this effect will feel an
	overwhelming urge to follow the suggestion throughout the course of
	their waking.  If for some reason some element of the suggestion seems
	wrong to the person they may try to shake it before carrying out the
	course of action (requires a willpower roll difficulty equal to number
	of successes of this power +2).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Dreamtime- the mutant is now capable of physically entering
	the Dreamscape.

Dream Travel (Mental) [AL]
	The mutant who has this Power has an extremely potent subconscious mind,
	which can affect the relationships between time and space.  By dreaming
	of a place that the mutant is familiar with, he can find himself waking
	up there in the morning.  Moreover, a mutant with this Power may buy
	the Background: Dream (from Mage: The Ascension) with Freebie Points.
	The mutant also has the equivalent of Psychic Defenses at the Rank of
	this Power versus any attempt to manipulate his dreams or his
	Mindscape by another person.  To travel, roll Wits + Dream Travel
	(difficulty 6 or as below).
	
	¥ The mutant can travel to any place which he knows very well (his
	apartment, childhood home, his old school, etc.)
	¥¥ Any place that the mutant has spent a lot of time can be a
	potential destination (perhaps a favorite bar, a little stretch of
	road he likes to walk down, a friend's house)
	¥¥¥ Any place the mutant has been to several times can be visited
	(diff 8)
	¥¥¥¥ Any place that the mutant has been to at least once can be
	visited (diff 9)
	¥¥¥¥¥ Any place that the mutant has a picture of, can identify on
	the map, or has been described in detail can be visited (diff 10).
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ All diffs reduced by 1.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ All diffs reduced by 1.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant can actually visit new dimensions that match
	his imaginings.  This can be very dangerous (diff 10).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ All diffs reduced by 1.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can actually visit times gone by (diff 10).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Perceive Eris- the mutant can recognize faeries on a successful
	Perception + Dream Travel roll (diff 6).
	¥¥ Dream Warrior- the mutant can forge himself weapons and armour
	in his dreams (each success on a Stamina + Dream Travel roll gives
	one Rank in Body Armour or Body Weaponry) to protect himself.

Duplication (Physical) [AL]
	The province of the Multiple Man, this power is invaluable in a combat
	situation.  Basically, the mutant may have up to two duplicate versions
	of himself for every point in Duplication- these duplicates are
	identical in all respects to the original, save only that they do not
	have the ability to further propagate themselves (unless the
	appropriate Power Stunt is taken)- in any case, at no time can the
	total number of active duplicates exceed the totals noted below.  Each
	of these duplicates can form separate memories, which then are shared
	when they merge again with the original.  If some of the duplicates are
	injured, then the second-least injured value is taken when they merge
	again with the original.  If one of the duplicates dies, all the
	duplicates must make a Willpower check or lose consciousness.  If the
	original is injured when he duplicates, the duplicates have the same
	Health Levels (at the outset) as he does.  A simple Stamina roll (diff
	8) is required to activate this Power.
	
	Note that Duplicates only possess the Passive powers of the mutant,
	with the exception of this one.  They cannot use such Powers as Energy
	Emission or Telepathy.
	
	Variation: Illusory Duplicates (Social/Mental) [AL]- like Mirage, you
	can create duplicates that are merely illusions.  These may either be
	static duplicates that move exactly the way you do (for two fewer
	Freebies or Experience per Rank) or they may move a bit more freely
	(at normal cost).
	
	¥ Two duplicates
	¥¥ Four duplicates
	¥¥¥ Six duplicates
	¥¥¥¥ Eight duplicates
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten duplicates
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Thirteen duplicates
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Sixteen duplicates
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Nineteen duplicates
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Twenty-two duplicates
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty-five duplicates
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Hive Mind- this nasty addition to the Duplication power allows the 
	mutant to share a telepathic bond with all of his duplicates, no matter
	the distance between them.  All duplicates automatically know what is
	happening to the others.
	¥¥ Mass Production- with this Power Stunt, the duplicates are capable
	of producing more duplicates, up to the maximum number possible for
	the mutant (a mutant with Duplication ¥¥¥ still cannot have more than
	six duplicates running around).
	¥¥¥ Self Cancelation- requires the Stunt: Mass Production.  A duplicate
	can cancel its own existence to allow more duplicates to be created.
	Unless the mutant has the Hive Mind stunt, all memories will be lost,
	but the original does not suffer whatever wounds the duplicate might
	have incurred.
	¥¥¥ True form- this ability allows the duplicates to survive the death
	of the original- without this Stunt they must die.  Each duplicate must
	make a Stamina check (diff. 9) or die even with this stunt, but one of
	them becomes the new 'original' if one or more survives.
	¥¥¥¥ Body Marks- this Stunt allows a mutant with an active body-
	altering Power (such as Matter Body, Physical Transformation, Physical
	Imitation, etc.) to duplicate himself while 'shifted'.  The duplicates
	appear in the same state as the mutant is in; however, they are
	incapable of changing back to the mutant's "default" state.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Age variable- the duplicates need not be the same age as the
	original.  This can make a great disguise.
	
	Duplication/Teleportation Combination Stunt:
	¥/¥ Extend Range- the mutant's duplicates may appear at some distance
	from the mutant when first created.  This requires a Stamina + Teleport
	roll (diff 8).  The maximum range is the same as the mutant's range in
	Teleportation.  Note that since Teleportation is not a passive Power,
	the duplicate will be unable to teleport back.

Earth Control (Social) [AL]
	This is a spiritual power more than anything else- the ability to speak
	to the earth and get it to do what you want it to.  Terra Firma has this
	Power, among others.  The ground can be made to move at your bidding,
	and even attack folks.  Usually requires a Manipulation + Earth Control
	to work, though attacks are Wits + Earth Control (diff 6).
	
	¥ Any dirt or stone product can be manipulated in its shape by this power-
	up to a ton can be reshaped with a moment's concentration into whatever
	form you choose.  This is a pretty sluggish movement, so it will only
	inflict up to one Health Level of damage the first turn, if it hits the
	target at all (diff 4 to Dodge the Wits + Earth Control attack).  More
	muddy ground will be more difficult to avoid, but also inflicts less
	(at this Rank, no) damage.
	¥¥ Up to five tons of earth or stone can be manipulated.  Up to three
	Health Levels of damage can be inflicted (diff 5 to Dodge).
	¥¥¥ Up to ten tons of earth or stone can be manipulated.  Up to five
	Health Levels of damage can be inflicted (diff 6 to Dodge).
	¥¥¥¥ Up to fifteen tons of earth or stone can be manipulated.  Up to
	seven Health Levels of damage can be inflicted (diff 7 to Dodge).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to twenty-five tons of earth or stone can be manipulated.  Up
	to nine Health Levels of damage can be inflicted (diff 7 to Dodge).
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Up to one hundred tons of earth or stone can be manipulated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Up to two hundred tons of earth or stone.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Up to five hundred tones of earth or stone.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Up to a kiloton of earth or stone.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to five kilotons.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Earth Immunity- the mutant gets one automatic soak per Rank versus
	any earth or stone attack.  If she has the Ore Power Stunt, she has
	this bonus versus metal, as well.
	¥ Feel Earth- the mutant can determine what minerals are in one unit
	of earth (one unit is the amount that the mutant's Rank allows her
	to manipulate).
	¥¥ Earth Breathing- the mutant may literally breathe dirt as if it were
	oxygen.  Traveling through solid rock would be like hiking through the
	Himalayas, though-- much less sustenance.
	¥¥ Ore- the mutant can manipulate metals if they are in ore form.
	¥¥ Projectile- the earth coughs up stones to throw at the victim or any
	other object, rather than making a Melee attack.  Int + Earth Control
	to hit.
	¥¥¥ Entomb- the mutant can speak to the earth and cause it to hold a
	victim fast at the feet.  The victim gets a Dodge (diff 6) to avoid
	this fate.  If he so chooses, the mutant can totally entomb the
	victim in the following round (if she does not escape).
	¥¥¥ Surfing the stone- the earth can be made to act like a fluid,
	causing a wave to form and propel the mutant safely along at a speed
	of up to 10 mph per Rank.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Call Magma- the mutant can call lava up from the depths of the
	earth to burn her enemies.  This requires concentration.  The lava
	arrives in five rounds minus one round per success, and is difficulty
	nine to soak.

Elastic Body (Physical) [AL]
	In combat, this power has a variety of applications which make an
	otherwise boring-seeming ability into a highly effective one.  The
	mutant has the ability to stretch his flesh to great lengths- even his
	bones become elastic and malleable when the power is used.  Dr. Reed
	Richards has the most effective variant of this power, but Skin of
	Generation X also possesses it.  Under exceptional circumstances, a
	Stamina + Elastic Body or a Dexterity + Elastic Body roll might be
	called for, but usually, no roll is required.
	
	¥ The mutant's limbs can stretch up to 5 feet past their original
	lengths.
	¥¥ Stretch factor is 10 feet
	¥¥¥ 15 feet
	¥¥¥¥ 20 feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ 25 feet
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ 50 feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ 100 feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ 200 feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ 500 feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ 1000 feet
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	It is the power stunts that come with this power which make it so
	darned nasty.  Few people would want to tangle with Mr. Fantastic in a
	fist-fight.
	¥ Resilience- the mutant's body can take more punishment than a normal
	human's.  Once this stunt is developed, the mutant will never lose dice
	from her Stamina pool due to damage-related dice penalties.
	¥ Stretch with Punch- the mutant can 'go limp' and allow his body to
	stretch with a blow.  This allows him to add his Elastic Body Power
	Rank to his Soak dice pool.  Only works against blunt objects.
	¥ Thin out- the mutant may reduce any particular dimension of her body
	(length, width, depth) by expanding one or both of the other
	dimensions.  This allows her to escape bonds, go under doors, etc.
	Requires a successful Dexterity + Elastic Body (diff 5).
	¥¥ Bounce- the mutant can make controlled 'bounces', effectively
	doubling his jumping distance (horizontal and vertical), but must make
	a successful Perception + Athletics (diff 6) in order to land properly.
	¥¥ Pancake- against crushing blows, the mutant's body can 'pancake',
	going flat and thin.  This allows him to add his Elastic Body Power
	Rank as automatic soak successes vs. blunt force trauma.
	¥¥ Missile Rebound- blunt missiles thrown or fired at the mutant can be
	thrown back using the mutant's stretchiness- the hit roll is equal to
	the Power Rank in Elastic Body.  Requires the Stunt: Stretch with
	Punch.
	¥¥¥ Bulk up- the mutant can balloon his body to great size, allowing
	him to add his Power Rank to his Strength score.
	¥¥¥ Shapeshift- the mutant can arrange himself into new shapes like a
	gigantic ball, or match the interior shape of a container (like a
	suitcase).  This does not allow you to look like Mel Gibson.  This
	requires a Strength + Elastic Body roll (diff 6).
	¥¥¥¥ Edge Defense- The mutant's body is so stretchy that even sharp
	objects are subject to his Stretch with Punch power stunt.
	¥¥¥¥ Entrapment- the mutant may purchase the Power: Entrapment with
	Experience points.
	¥¥¥¥ Fine Control- requires the Stunt: Shapeshift.  The mutant can
	shift his facial features and build about until he looks like Mel
	Gibson (Strength + Elastic Body, diff 9).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Brain Elasticity- mental attacks (such as Hypnosis, Voice of
	Command, Telepathic Invisibility, etc.) are resisted as normal, but
	the mutant may make additional resistance rolls on subsequent rounds,
	reducing the difficulty to do so by one each round until he is free.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Elastic Blood- cellular bodily fluids (such as blood) may be made
	elastic by spending a point of Power Charge and rolling Stamina +
	Elastic Body (diff 8), preventing blood loss and other such calamities.

Eldritch Bolt (Social/Mental) [AH]
	It may be a high-concentration Power, but Eldritch Bolt packs a big
	wallop.  Most typically possessed by mutants with other magical 
	abilities, Eldritch Bolt is a magical energy blast that closely
	resembles lightning.  It is often purple, green, or some other wild
	colour.  Treat it as an Energy power for the purposes of figuring
	damage, which is typically two dice per Rank (but there are a number
	of optional systems).
	
	No roll is required to activate the Power, but a Dex + Directed
	Blast is needed to actually hit someone with an Eldritch Bolt.  Note
	that this is a high concentration Power, so remember dice pool
	splitting issues.
	
	As this is a magical energy Power, it is not resisted by Energy
	Resistance.  It is susceptible to the effects of Powers like
	Magic Resistance and Magic Absorption/Conversion, however.

Electrokinesis (Mental) [AH]
	This Power is more closely akin to Pyrokinesis than Energy Emission.
	The mutant who uses it can concentrate and excite charged particles,
	causing them to move and collect as he wills.  While this requires
	more concentration than Energy Emission or Energy Control, the results
	can also be more spectacular.  The mutant can 'call up' electricity
	in any area within line-of-sight; the difficulty varies with the
	conditions.  (Creating an electrical shock in a carpeted area next
	to an empty light socket in a power plant in the winter would be 
	difficulty 3.  Doing the same inside a static-proof bag in the tropics
	would be difficulty 10.)  The standard roll for this Power is
	Perception + Electrokinesis.
	
	¥ Two Health Levels of static discharge can be created, or dampened,
	or redirected.
	¥¥ Three Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥¥ Four Health Levels of damage.  This takes two rounds to build
	under normal circumstances.  If the charge is triggered before it
	is ready, it inflicts two Health Levels.  If the charge in question
	is being redirected or dampened, rather than created, then no such
	time lapse is necessary.
	¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels of damage.  Three rounds (two Health Levels
	on round one, four on round two).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Six Health Levels of damage.  This takes three rounds to
	build under normal circumstances.  On round one, the charge would
	inflict two Health Levels.  On round two, it would inflict four.
	Redirection or dampening does not take more than one round.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Eight Health Levels (four/round)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Ten Health Levels (five/round)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Twelve Health Levels (six/round)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Sixteen Health Levels (eight/round)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty Health Levels (ten/round)
	
	If the mutant's concentration is disrupted while she is building
	or holding a charge it either immediately discharges (causing
	damage if appropriate) or fades out into latent static, which lowers
	the difficulty for the mutant's next roll to build a charge in
	that area by two (or increases the difficulty to redirect or dampen 
	a charge in the area by one).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Microlevels- the mutant can detect and control very small 
	amounts of electricity, such as those powering the human nervous
	system.

Emanation Tracking (Mental) [AL]
	Every species that wields power has an 'aura' or 'signature' that it 
	gives off to those that can distinguish them.  A mutant with emanation
	tracking can not only perceive these emanations, but she can also
	follow the faint trails that they leave on the psychic plane when a
	being of power passes.  Each species (be they mutant, inhuman, or
	some type of alien) has a distinctive emanation.  Within each species,
	there is identifiable variability in the emanations.  Thus, the tracker
	can recognize the emanations of specific people, if she is sufficiently
	familiar with them (usually an Intelligence + Area Knowledge roll).
	The normal system, however, is Perception + Emanation Tracking (diff 6
	plus one for every two hours that have passed since the trail was
	lain).
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant can track the faint psychic trails left by passing
	beings of power.  These trails last one hour per point of Power Potential
	that the being has (or equivalent measure of power, like Arte).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Aura Sight- you may purchase the Power: Aura Sight with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Gauge Potential- the mutant can gauge the other being's Power
	Potential at a glance, if he is familiar with the species.  Perception +
	Emanation Tracking (diff 6).
	¥¥¥ Isolate- the mutant can distinguish individual powers (if she is
	familiar with the emanations of another being of the same species who
	has the same power) at a glance.  Perception + Emanation Tracking (diff
	varies with the level of familiarity).
	¥¥¥ PSM- the tracker can see, from spoor or direct line of sight, if a
	target's Powers are physical, social, or mental in nature.

Empathic Blast (Social/Mental) [AL]
	Like Bliss of DV8, a mutant with this Power can cause the bits of your
	brain in charge of emotion and other such sensations to overload,
	which can cause damage (as well as other unpleasant effects).  Bliss
	is known for a pleasure/pain 1-2 combo that tends to make her targets
	writhe.  In any case, the basic effects of the blast remain the same,
	no matter how the target is being overstimulated.  This Power either
	operates by touch (Dex + Brawl required to hit) or through an actual
	blast (Dex + Directed Blast).  This is decided when the power is
	chosen.

	¥ No damage, -2 dice penalty for next round.
	¥¥ One Health Level of damage, -2 dice penalty for 2 rounds, make
	a Willpower check (diff 6) or lose a Temporary point of Willpower
	¥¥¥ Two Health Levels of damage, -3 dice penalty for 4 rounds, make
	a Willpower check (diff 7) or lose 2 Temporary points of Willpower
	¥¥¥¥ Three Health Levels of damage, -2 dice penalty for a scene, make
	a Willpower check (diff 8) or lose 3 Temporary points of Willpower
	and lose a point of Wits for the scene.  Stamina check (diff 6) to
	remain conscious.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels of damage, -3 dice penalty for a scene, make
	a Willpower check (diff 9) or lose 4 Temporary points of Willpower
	and lose 2 points of Wits for the scene.  Stamina check (diff 7) to
	remain conscious.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Satiation- victims who are affected by the Empathic Blast are made
	numb by the overload, and must make a Willpower check (diff equal to
	the Willpower loss diff) in order to initiate any action for a number
	of rounds equal to the mutant's Rank.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Suggestion- victims who lose all Willpower become highly
	suggestible, and will do anything the mutant says, short of self-
	destructive actions.

Empathic Energy Absorption/Conversion (Social/Mental) [AN]
	As with Powerhaus of DV8, your mutant can use this Power to absorb
	ambient empathic (emotional) energy, and convert it into a form that
	he can use.  Such emotions are drained from the surrounding area and
	people, which will tend to have a calming, deadening effect on a
	situation.  The average situation will not provide enough ambient
	emotional energy to use; there must be tension, excitement, fear, or
	anger present.  Combat usually provides such things in abundance.
	Mutants with Rage or a Power that has the Flaw: Empathic Link attached
	to it should dread this Power.  A Perception + Empathic Energy A/C
	roll (diff 6) is required to turn this power on; once on, a similar
	roll is required to shut it off.  No other roll or concentration is
	required.
	
	See the Power: Empathic Tracking for some guidelines on what
	constitutes Empathic Energy; treat the emotions that a Rank ¥¥¥¥¥
	Empathic Tracker can follow as Rank ¥ emotional effects, while Rank
	¥¥¥ Empathic Tracking emotions equate to Rank ¥¥¥ emotional effects,
	and Rank ¥ Empathic Tracking emotions equate to Rank ¥¥¥¥¥ emotional
	effects.

	Common Variations:
	* Strength- one point of absorbed energy can be converted to one
	point of Strength; the maximum number of points that can be converted
	in this way is the mutant's Rank in this Power.  This Strength lasts
	one scene or until consciously shed by the mutant.
	* Stamina- as Strength
	* Energy- the mutant converts one point of energy into one effective
	Rank of Energy Emission; a double-cost energy would make this a
	double-cost Power.
	* Mirror- the mutant can re-project the emotion into the surrounding
	area (range as per the equivalent Rank of Projective Empathy), thus
	amplifying it.  Nervousness can be turned into panic this way, and
	it can be re-absorbed for use with another variation of this Power,
	if the mutant has more than one.
	* Empathic Boost- if the mutant has a Power with the Flaw: Empathic
	Link, he can use this Power to fuel it, adding extra dice to the
	initial roll or damage pool as applicable.

	¥ The mutant can absorb one die or Rank worth of empathic energy at
	a time, to a maximum of one die absorbed.  This rate of absorption is
	the typical level for most situations, though of course the total
	amount of energy that can be absorbed is ruled by the mutant's rank
	in this Power.
	¥¥ The mutant can absorb two dice or Ranks worth of empathic energy at
	a time, to a maximum of two dice absorbed.  This rate of absorption is
	the maximum for most situations, unless an empathic Power is involved.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb three dice or Ranks worth of empathic energy
	at a time, to a maximum of three dice.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb four dice or Ranks worth of empathic energy
	at a time, to a maximum of four dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb five dice or Ranks worth of empathic energy
	at a time, to a maximum of five dice.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can absorb six Ranks worth of empathic energy at a
	time, to a maximum of seven dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can absorb seven Ranks at a time, to a maximum of
	nine dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb eight Ranks at a time, to a max of
	eleven dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb nine Ranks at a time, to a max of
	thirteen dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb ten Ranks at a time, to a max of
	fifteen dice.

Empathic Forcefield (Social/Mental) [AN]
	This Power is similar in some respects to the Forcefield Power, with
	two provisos.  Firstly, it is a continually active Power that requires
	no concentration (or indeed, attention) on the part of the mutant.
	Secondly, it only functions against physical entities that are capable
	of emotion, and their immediate emanations.  That is, it might keep out
	an alien, or a dog, or even the alien's fire emission power, but it
	wouldn't keep out a thrown knife or a robot.  This forcefield
	typically protects against entities suffering one particular type of
	emotional state, such as hostility toward the mutant.  No roll is
	required.  This Power's empathic element functions on a low empathic
	level similar to that accessed by Combat Telepathy, and as such it
	is not resisted by Psychic Defenses, Telepathy, etc. (though it may
	be fooled by a canny combination of Passive and Projective Empathy,
	or even Empathic Resistance).  Dr. Cecilia Reyes has this Power.
	
	Whenever an eligible candidate comes into contact with the protected
	area (roughly five feet from the mutant's body in all directions),
	the field instantly activates, which will make the mutant aware of
	the contact.  If someone teleports inside the area, they will be
	pushed out with the field's Strength.  Failing that, the mutant will
	be pushed away from the entity with the field's Strength.  If that
	fails, then the field will only protect against other candidates
	outside the field.
	
	Note that the Strength rating of the field does not determine whether
	a person can enter it (the Health of the field must be disrupted
	first).  The mutant can resist being 'pushed' by people outside the
	field with his Strength or his field's Strength, whichever is higher.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Vs. Hostiles- protection against those who mean harm to the mutant
	* Vs. Deceivers- protection against those seeking to mislead the
	mutant in some way
	* Vs. Aliens- protection against those whose emotional emanations
	differ significantly from those of humans.
	* Vs. Sneaks- protection from those who seek to remain undetected or
	unnoticed.
	
	Special Variation: Detection Link (3 Freebies)
	* If the mutant has a Detection Power (such as Danger Sense or even
	Altered Perceptions: Spatial Sense), that does not require a sense
	organ to function, the field can be triggered by this stimulus instead
	of an external emotional stimulus.  Cecilia Reyes has this variation.
	
	¥ Forcefields erected by this Power have an effective Strength and 
	Stamina of 2, and can take 2 Health Levels of damage before losing
	integrity.  All excess (unsoaked) damage passes through the field to 
	the target.
	¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 3, and can 
	take 3 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 4, and can 
	take 4 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 5, and can 
	take 5 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 6, and can 
	take 6 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Forcefields have one effective Strength, Stamina, and Health
	rating of 8, plus one automatic soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength, Stamina, and Health
	rating of 10.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 12, and
	two automatic soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 14.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 16, and
	three automatic soak.
	
	Forcefields that have taken some punishment can be revitalized
	(healed) with concentration.  A Charisma + Forcefield roll (diff 6)
	will 'heal' one Health Level of damage per success, so long as
	the field still has at least one Health Level left or if the
	character has made a successful Willpower check (as above).

Empathic Resistance (Social/Mental) [PN]
	The ability to resist emotional assaults is a useful one, as any
	mutant who has encountered creatures like D'Spayre can attest.  This
	Power functions much like Psychic Defense- it grants extra dice to use
	to resist such Powers as Projective Empathy and the Blood Bond, which
	both manipulate the emotions.  If a Willpower check is required under
	these criteria, these dice are added to that roll.  If no roll is
	normally allowed to resist an Empathic effect, roll the Empathic
	Resistance dice alone.
	
	¥ One die is added to the mutant's empathic defense pool.
	¥¥ Two dice
	¥¥¥ Three dice
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six dice, one auto-success
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven dice, two auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight dice, three auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine dice, four auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten dice, five auto-successes
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Fearless- each Rank in this Power reduces the effective Rank of 
	any Horror Factor arrayed against him, in addition to this Power's
	regular effects against the Horror Factor.
	¥ Resist Vampirism- a Psychic Vampire has no handles on someone with
	this Stunt, who uses Willpower + Empathic Resistance in a resisted
	roll against any such attack.
	¥¥ Jaded- any Power Stunt associated with Mega-Charisma, Mega-Wits,
	or Mega-Appearance can be resisted with this Power.

Empathic Shapeshifting (Physical/Social/Mental) [AL]
	Possessed by the irrepressible Meggan of Excalibur, this is the
	ability to change your body based on the feelings and beliefs of
	others- either proactively or reactively.  In either words, this Power
	is always at work, but it can also be used deliberately. Like
	Projective Empathy, this Power gives the ability to 'read' the
	emotions of others (unless they have Empathic Resistance or Psychic
	Defense), which is a Perception + Empathy roll (the Empathy Talent is
	found on the character sheet), typically difficulty 4 unless the
	person is especially defensive or secretive.  To 'read' the underlying
	thought, concept, or percept that has triggered the emotion is a
	Perception + Empathy (diff 6-10).  To shapeshift deliberately in
	reaction to an emotion is a Stamina + Empathic Shapeshifting roll
	(diffs vary with the amount of change required).

	Note that the empath cannot control exactly what he shapeshifts into,
	and frequently will not know what he will look like until he actually
	shifts.  He cannot deliberately choose to look like a gargoyle, for
	instance.

	Note also that people who dislike the mutant will tend to make him
	appear less attractive, etc.- actually lowering his Attributes against
	his will- unless he takes an active role (shifting into a form that
	evokes feelings of fear or lust in the observer, etc.)

	¥ A mutant's hair color or general appearance may change with the
	opinions of others- he may be more attractive around those who
	think him nice or handsome (+1 Appearance), stronger around those
	who admire his physique (+1 Strength).  He may appear monstrous or
	hideous enough to lose Appearance points, and even cause a -1 dice
	penalty in a particular observer if he shifts to a form that the
	person fears.  He may reduce the difficulty for certain social rolls
	by one in some circumstances.  Changes in height and weight of 
	up to 5 percent are possible.
	¥¥ Up to two dots may be added or subtracted.  A monster out of
	nightmares can be simulated, allowing temporary Body Weaponry and
	Body Armour (if appropriate) of Rank ¥ stature, and he may even
	inflict a -2 dice penalty if his form is particularly dreaded.
	Social roll difficulties may be reduced by one under the right
	conditions.  Changes in height and weight of up to 20% are possible.
	¥¥¥ Up to three dots in any attribute may be added or subtracted.
	Body Weaponry/Body Armour ¥¥ can be created- up to a -2 dice penalty.
	Social difficulties may be reduced by two.  Changes in height and
	weight of up to 50%.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to four dots in any attribute may be added or subtracted.
	Body Weaponry/Body Armour ¥¥ can be created- up to a -3 dice penalty.
	Social difficulties may be reduced by two under the right conditions.
	Changes in height and weight of up to 75% are possible.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to five dots in any attribute may be added or subtracted.
	Body Weaponry/Body Armour ¥¥¥ can be created- up to a -3 dice penalty.
	Social difficulties may be reduced by three under the right
	conditions.  Changes in height and weight of up to 200% are possible.

Empathic Tracking (Physical/Mental) [PL/AL]
	The mutant has the capability of picking up emotional 'spoor' (ambient
	empathic energy) and following it to its source.  Each type of emotion
	leaves its own spoor, which can be identified by the mutant upon
	encountering it.  This Power is closely related to Psychic
	Impressions, but does not require the examination of objects.  Ambient
	empathic energy slowly fades; the stronger the emotion, the longer it
	lingers.  Note that mutants with Rage can always be tracked with this
	Power, no matter what their current mood.  A Perception + Empathic
	Tracking roll (diff varies with the quality of the spoor and other
	factors such as contamination by other strong emotions, but the base
	is 6) is required to use this Power.
	
	¥ Blinding anger, bliss, the blackest envy or jealousy, and suicidal
	depression can be tracked using this Power, or any other emotion of
	blinding intensity.  The spoor from such strong emotions is detectable
	for five minutes at this Rank.
	¥¥ Wrath, joy, jealousy, and sorrow, etc. can be tracked using this
	Power.  The spoor from emotions of this intensity is detectable for five
	minutes; stronger emotional spoor is detectable for fifteen minutes.
	A mutant with Rage, in any mood, can be detected for five minutes.
	¥¥¥ Anger, happiness, sadness, etc. can be tracked at this Rank for
	five minutes; slightly stronger spoor is detectable for fifteen minutes;
	the strongest spoor can be followed an hour later.
	¥¥¥¥ Strong annoyance, frustration, and other spoor of this nature can
	be followed up to five minutes after its passing; stronger emotions can
	be followed after fifteen minutes, an hour, or six hours, respectively.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mild annoyance, amusement, disapproval, and the like can be followed
	at a distance of five minutes; fifteen minutes, an hour, six hours, and
	one day for more powerful emotions.
	
Empathic Weaponry (Mental) [AN]
	The mutant channels the emotions that broil within herself (or within
	her victims) to create weaponry that grows in power.  It might start
	mild, but in a pain-filled or emotional climate, the weapon in question
	becomes deadly, indeed.  Note that Empathic Resistance is an effective
	armour against this weapon, serving as the equivalent rank of
	Invulnerability against it, and Empathic Energy Absorption/ Conversion
	may actively drain off its strength.  Activating this weapon requires
	the expenditure of a point of Willpower (or a level of empathic energy,
	if the mutant has a Power such as Empathic Energy A/C).  Difficulty to
	attack with the weapon is 6 with a firearm or 5 with a melee weapon.
	
	Special Flaw: Treacherous Soother (3 points): The weapon will become
	agitated when the mutant herself is feeling strong emotions (including
	any trait that she has a stunt to absorb, such as dice penalties if she
	has the Pain Absorption stunt).  Any botched roll made by the mutant
	while in combat will cause the weapon to treacherously twist and strike
	her, gaining power and draining her energy if she does not soak the
	damage as if she had the Soothing Blow stunt (whether she does or not).
	
	¥ The weapon (whether it is a melee or ranged weapon) starts as a base
	damage item no matter what its form.  Even a katana or bazooka will
	begin with a +0 damage bonus.  If a target suffering from a
	particularly strong emotion (blinding anger, bliss, the blackest envy
	or jealousy, suicidal depression, or any other emotion of blinding
	intensity) is successfully struck and suffers at least one Health Level
	of damage, the weapon increases in strength by +1.  It will increase in
	strength by one for each successful hit.  The power will last for the
	rest of the scene.  The maximum strength of the weapon is +3.  Enemies
	with the Rage trait always qualify, no matter what their mood may be.
	¥¥ The weapon will absorb power from a strong emotion such as wrath,
	joy, jealousy, or sorrow.  Maximum strength of the weapon is +4.
	¥¥¥ Power can be absorbed from moderate emotions such as anger,
	delight, or sadness.  Maximum strength of the weapon is +5.  Up to two
	charges may be absorbed at one blow.
	¥¥¥¥ Strong annoyance, frustration, or cheerfulness may be absorbed.
	Maximum strength of the weapon is +6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mild emotions (such as annoyance, amusement, or disapproval) may
	be absorbed.  Maximum strength of the weapon is +7.  Up to three charges
	may be absorbed at one blow.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Rage Drain - Any creature with the Rage trait, when struck, will lose
	one point of Rage when the weapon is fed.
	¥ Soothing Blow- requires the Stunt: Rage Drain.  If desired, the
	mutant may drain the emotion from the opponent, reducing it in
	intensity by one level with a successful draining strike.  If the
	target has stored emotional charges (such as Rage, but also stored
	energy for Emotional Energy A/C, if the weapon has more force than that
	Power can absorb; or even another person with Empathic Weaponry), these
	charges can be drained for the benefit of the weapon.
	¥ Vibrator- the weapon effectively has the Power: Detection (Empathic
	Energy).  It begins to vibrate or hum when a person within the mutant's
	line of sight is sufficiently emotional to feed the weapon.
	¥¥ Pain absorption- the weapon can feed from physical pain.  If a
	successfully struck target is suffering from dice penalties (either
	before or as a result of the damage from the weapon), it counts as an
	absorption.  At higher Ranks in this Power, as many charges can be
	drained as the target has in dice penalties (thus, a Crippled Foe, so
	struck, could theoretically give as many as five charges per blow to
	the weapon).
	¥¥ Release- the mutant may expend a charge from the weapon (rather than
	absorbing one) on a successful blow to instil a particular emotion into
	the target.  This includes any additional trait that she has the ability
	to absorb through stunts (such as dice penalties or rage).
	¥¥¥ Resolution- any creature with the Iron Will Power will feed the
	weapon, regardless of mood.
	¥¥¥¥ Blood Pool- the emotive power of the blood pool trait is such that
	the mutant's weapon will target it, draining as many points of it in
	any given round as Health Levels of damage that the target fails to
	soak. This only applies if the target is feeling enough emotion to
	otherwise feed the weapon.
	¥¥¥¥ Despair- requires the Stunts: Rage Drain and Resolution.  Each
	blow struck with the weapon will drain its target of Willpower (unless
	the target still has points of Rage).

Endopathy (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	Curiously, a mutant with this Power is capable of communicating with
	his own body as if it were a collection of separate entities.  Thus,
	the mutant may address his stomach, his skeleton, etc.  This allows
	him to perform a number of tricks with his body that others would find
	astonishing.  For example, he could simulate the symptoms of any given
	disease on command, speed up or slow down his heartbeat, refuse to
	digest something he swallowed, prevent a poison from passing through
	his stomach lining, or get his blood to un-clot in a certain place.
	All Endopathy effects require concentration.  This is usually a
	Charisma + Endopathy roll (diff 6), though really bizarre requests may
	increase the difficulty.
	
	¥ Heal at twice normal rate; organs perform their normal functions to
	the mutant's specifications; resist Rank one Biomanipulation.
	¥¥ Heal one Health Level per day; organs can stop performing their
	normal functions; resist Rank two Biomanipulation.
	¥¥¥ Heal one Health Level per hour; organs can perform their normal
	functions in unusual ways.
	¥¥¥¥ Heal one Health Level per minute; organs can cooperate to do
	really strange things (would you like your heart to move two
	centimetres to the left?)
	¥¥¥¥¥ Heal one Health Level per round; organs can do certain things
	that they aren't supposed to (want to heal some spinal damage?)


							THE ENERGY LIST

	There are several varieties of energy-affecting powers, and most of
	the variations apply to one specific form of energy.  This is a list
	of types of energy that can be manipulated with all of these powers.
	The energies marked with an asterisk are double-cost powers and may
	not be allowed by the Storyteller.  Ask first.  Yes, I know that 'fire'
	isn't an energy.  Shut up.  Note that Sound, Vibration, and Explosive
	Force are treated separately.
	
	Damage tests have been shown to be problematic.  Try using a damage
	pool equal to the character's Rank + the number of successes on the
	Dexterity + Directed Blast roll, or (if you want energy to be even
	more devastating) the number of successes on a Dex + Directed Blast
	TIMES the character's Rank.
	
	Balefire*
	Cold
	Darkforce
	Electricity
	Energy force
	Fire
	Gamma Radiation
	Gravitic
	Hard Radiation*
	Heat (Microwaves)
	Kinetic force
	Light
	Magnetic force*
	Nether
	Nexus force*
	Nullfire*
	Plasma
	Positrons
	Purifying light
	Radio Waves
	X-Rays
	
	Balefire- This is a chaotic, corrupting green flame that has nasty
	effects on its targets.  You'd have to be evil to want this one.  It
	has the consistency of wispy wax, like thick plasma.  It takes twice
	as long to heal than normal and may have unpredictable effects on your
	mental and physical health.  Difficulty 9 to soak.
	
	Cold- Not ice, though it can result from the use of this power; this
	is the raw frigid temperature that kills you in the Arctic.  If your
	character reaches Rank 7 in this power, he will be able to stop all
	molecular motion in most targets.  Iceman has it.
	
	Darkforce- OK, this is one that you don't bring home to mother.  It
	draws on nethermantic darkness to freeze, blind, and drain you.  In
	order to resist this one, you'd need invulnerability or some sort of
	light control.  Basically, it is the 'negative' version of plasma.
	Can develop Darksight as a power stunt.  Drains a point of Willpower
	when you roll at least one '10'.
	
	Electricity- A good wall-socket style zap of raw voltage.  Think of
	dear old Electro.  Plays havoc with the nervous systems of most
	beings.  Get damage bonuses if you attack them through the metal
	they are carrying.
	
	Energy force- a combination of energy and force attacks, this one is
	hard to stand up against.  It does not have the collateral effects
	that the other powers do, but still damages people who just have
	Energy Resistance.  Havok and Cyclops each have a variant.
	
	Fire- Heat plus light.  You can light stuff on fire so that your
	targets continue to take damage after you've stopped attacking
	them.  Not nice at all.  The Human Torch can do this.  Lights stuff
	up whenever you roll a '10' unless you roll a corresponding '1'.
	
	Gravitic- a distortion in space/time that behaves as though it has
	mass.  It doesn't strike with a palpable force so much as add too much
	"virtual mass" to objects it comes into contact with, distorting their
	shapes and causing softer or more fragile things to collapse upon
	themselves.  On every '10' rolled for damage, it temporarily impairs
	a living creature's Dexterity, draining it by one point (this is 
	recovered at the end of the scene).

	Hard Radiation- This is the stuff that comes out of the atomic bomb.
	You don't want to play with it.  Anyone exposed to it, unless they
	have some sort of protection, will shortly be getting radiation 
	sickness (which often kills) and may mutate further.  It is difficulty
	9 to soak.
	
	Heat- Raw microwaves.  Heat is everywhere, and thus so easy to
	manipulate.  It is also invisible, and thus it can be hard to track
	the source of a heat blast.  Can start flammable objects on fire.
	Lights stuff up when you get 2 '10's for damage.
	
	Kinetic force- Energy Resistance isn't going to help you against
	this one.  It's like a good old-fashioned punch in the head.  You
	can grossly manipulate objects with it as well as attack people.
	Gambit channels kinetic force.
	
	Light- All manner of variations, including the highly damaging
	laser.  You can light up a room, create illusions (if you have
	light control) blind people, become invisible (light control)
	or any number of other things.
	
	Magnetic force- Not for nothing is Magneto the most feared mutant
	on the planet.  You can affect ferrous metals (including nickel
	and cobalt) at low levels, but later all sorts of metals.  At very
	high levels, start buying the ability to play with any other E-M
	energy, gravity, electricity, etc.  Live in fear.
	
	Nether- aiyeeyah.  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  Otherwise known
	as Entropy, a Nether blast directly saps energy.  Cosmetically,
	things struck by Entropy seem to age a little bit-- this doesn't
	happen in fact.  Black and green 'unlight'.  It directly disrupts
	any energy it comes into contact with, except magical energy (i.e.,
	a Rank three blast of Nether will cancel a Rank two blast of Fire,
	and still have one Rank of juice left).
	
	Nexus force- A chaotic and unpredictable jumbling of the way space
	and time relate to each other.  The raw stuff of the dimensional
	barrier.  Your targets can be teleported, scrambled, aged, cut in
	half, etc. (depending on your power level).  You cannot control the
	effect that nexus will take, but it's usually pretty darned nasty.
	
	Nullfire- a white-hot band of flame that annihilates living matter
	when it strikes it (no effect on nonliving matter) to such an
	extent that any living being who is killed by it ceases to exist-
	retroactively.
	
	Plasma- Superheated gas, thick and wispy.  Plasma can start fires
	and it sometimes sticks to targets for more damage.  Causes the
	same sort of nastiness as fire.  Lights stuff up on a '10'.
	
	Positrons- a stream of positively charged particles, capable of
	neutralizing electrons.  Positron streams can disrupt electricity
	and inflict damage on a target by pulling electrons away from a
	person's body.  This is not aggravated damage, as these missing
	electrons will automatically be restored from the environment.
	
	Purifying light- a curious energy, in many ways the antithesis of
	balefire.  Dagger can fire knives made of this energy.  It removes
	chemical impurities and, at high levels, even insanity, diseases,
	etc.  More painful to the more impure.
	
	Radio Waves- OK, so maybe this one is a little weird to take as
	your power since it would be hard to imagine radio waves hurting
	anybody.  Still, you've got the option, folks.  Mess up your enemy
	communications, send false messages, make your own TV broadcasts,
	etc.
	
	X-Rays- If you can also see them, X-Ray Emission makes for a great
	detective power.  At high levels, (including Rank ¥- hey, it's
	more concentrated than your dentist's machine) it can damage your
	opponents.


Energy Absorption and Conversion (Social) [AN]
	This nasty power's most notable holder is Bishop of the X-Men.  It
	allows a mutant to absorb energy attacks and convert them into a
	form that can be used by the mutant.  Many variations on this power
	exist.  The maximum amount of energy that can be absorbed safely is
	equal to the mutant's Power Rank.  If the mutant has the Power Stunt:
	Store Energy, he can store energy up to his maximum level and still
	absorb that again without damage; however, this latter energy must
	be released within one round or it will damage the mutant normally.
	Any energy that strikes the mutant over and above this will harm
	him normally.  No roll is required.
	
	Note that a double-cost energy type is considered to be worth
	double (that is, one Rank is absorbed as two) for the purposes of
	this Power.

	¥ One Rank of damage (two Health Levels) is automatically absorbed
	and converted.
	¥¥ Two Ranks
	¥¥¥ Three Ranks
	¥¥¥¥ Four Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Ranks

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten Ranks

	Common Variations:
	* Energy Mirror- the mutant absorbs energy only to re-release it in
	the same form.  A Dexterity + Directed Blast is required to hit.
	* Energy Conversion- the mutant changes the energy into another form
	before releasing it (Siege converts energy of all sorts to plasma).
	A Dexterity + Directed Blast is required to hit.
	* Health Conversion- the mutant heals a Health Level of normal damage
	for every Rank absorbed, or a Level of aggravated damage for every
	two Ranks.  'Overlap damage' that he does not soak is eligible to
	be healed with the energy that he did soak from the same attack.
	* Power Charge- the mutant restores lost points of Power Charge-- he
	must have expended some Power Charge in order to make the conversion.
	* Skewed Mirror- the mutant absorbs energy only to re-release it in
	the opposite form.  Thus, Purifying Light becomes Balefire, Cold 
	becomes Heat, Electricity becomes Positrons, Plasma becomes Darkforce,
	Nullfire becomes Nexus.  Electro-magnetic energy becomes Nether.
	If no opposite is obvious, use either Light or Energy Force.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- the mutant can store absorbed energy in his pattern
	for future use.
	¥¥¥¥ Energy Vacuum- by making a Charisma + Energy Absorption roll,
	the mutant can 'call' energy to himself as an action.  In this wise,
	he can pull an energy strike away from its intended target and
	absorb the energy himself.  He must garner more successes for more
	distant energy streams (ST's discretion).

	Many Stunts for Energy Emission can also be developed by a mutant with
	the Energy Mirror or Energy Conversion variations.

Energy Body (Social) [AL]
	A deadly ability in its own right, this power allows a mutant to change
	his body into a sort of living energy.  Captain Marvel could do this;
	Shard has a Light Body.  Besides giving most of the benefits of energy
	emission, the character is less vulnerable to attack while in an energy
	form.  Beware, though- facing a mutant who can control the sort of energy
	that you are composed of may prove lethal.  Zzaxx discovered, to his
	dismay, that his electrical body could be grounded and dispersed.  No
	roll is required except under exceptional circumstances (Stamina +
	Energy Body).
	
	¥ Mutant has one point of Strength, normal Dexterity and Stamina.  Can
	fire energy blasts with two dice per Rank in the damage pool while in
	energy form.  Add one die to Brawling damage dice pools in combat due
	to the intensity of the energy that makes up his body.  Normal weapons
	subtract three dice from their damage pools vs. the mutant.
	¥¥ Mutant has, at maximum, 3 points of Strength (or his natural score,
	if it is less).  Brawling attacks do two extra dice of damage.  Normal
	weapons lose four dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥¥ The mutant has his normal Strength score, whatever that might be.
	Brawling attacks do three extra dice of damage.  Normal weapons lose
	five dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥¥¥ Brawling attacks do four extra dice of damage.  Normal weapons
	lose six dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Brawling attacks do five extra dice of damage.  Normal weapons
	lose seven dice from their damage pools.
	
	Variation: Energy Body (Mimic)*- The Absorbing Man, unfortunately, has
	this variation in addition to Matter Body (Mimic)*, which is why he is
	able to fight people like the Avengers or Magneto or the Hulk by
	himself.  Any kind of energy that the mutant is exposed to may be
	mimicked, with predictably evil results.  This requires a successful
	Stamina check (diff 6).
	
	Variation: Energy Body (Duplicate)- oddly enough, your mutant creates
	an energy body and projects her consciousness into it, leaving her
	regular body behind.  This has the advantage that the energy body can
	be discorporated or killed without destroying the hero, but her regular
	body is vulnerable so long as she is animating the Energy Body.  The
	regular body will starve or dehydrate eventually if it the mutant does
	not return to it (or arrange for its care).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Energy Resistance- the mutant has one automatic soak vs. his own sort
	of energy for every point of Energy Body he has, even when he is not in
	the Energy Body.
	¥¥ Energy Emission- the mutant may purchase the power: Energy Emission
	(relating to the form of power that makes up his Energy Body) with
	experience points, even if he did not start the game with that power.
	¥¥ Flight- if the mutant's power is an appropriate sort (Heat Body, for
	instance) he can use it to fly with a Dexterity + Flight roll.  Flight
	is a Skill.
	¥¥ Partial Shift- The character can alter the form of one body part at 
	a time.  This is a Stamina + Energy Body roll (diff 6).
	¥¥ Power Line Travel- a mutant with an Electricity Body can travel along
	power lines at enormous speeds (he can cross the globe in seconds) while
	maintaining body integrity.  This requires a Stamina + Energy Body roll.
	¥¥¥ Energy Healing- the mutant, when exposed to outside energy that 
	matches his energy body (a Fire Body mutant is struck by fire, etc.) is 
	healed for a number of Health Levels equal to the damage that would 
	normally have been inflicted.
	¥¥¥ Energy Immunity- the mutant can never be harmed by the energy that
	composes his Energy Body, even when he is not in the Energy Body.
	¥¥¥ Kamikaze Burst- the mutant can sacrifice Health Levels in order to
	increase the power of his blasts (one Health Level per die added to the
	damage pool).  This damage can be soaked, but the effort is exhausting.

Energy Body Parts (Social) [AN]
	One of the mutant's body parts is permanently composed of a type of
	energy found on the Energy List.  Unlike Energy Body, this isn't a
	temporary condition; without Power Stunts, that body part will always
	be composed of energy.  The part fulfils its normal function faithfully,
	but may otherwise have resistances and vulnerabilities that normal parts
	of the type do not.  Note that the mutant is absolutely immune to
	being damaged by the energy of his 'type'.  No roll is required.
	
	Note that this Power operates in the same wise as Extra Body Parts; it
	should be considered a one-time purchase rather than a Power that can
	be improved-- except under exceptional circumstances as approved by the
	Storyteller.

	¥ A small external part, such as an eye or hand, can be made of energy.
	Attacks specifically targeting this area are less effective,  Normal
	weapons subtract three dice from their damage pools vs. the mutant's
	body part.  Add one die to Brawling damage dice pools, if appropriate,
	due to the intensity of the energy that makes up his body part.  Any
	non-standard one-point external Extra Body Part (such as a tentacle,
	tail, or fur, but not a leg) may be made of Energy.
	¥¥ A larger external part, such as a lower leg or forearm, can be made
	of energy. Attacks specifically targeting this area are less
	effective, Normal weapons lose four dice from their damage pools.
	Brawling attacks do two extra dice of damage.  An internal organ (such
	as the heart, stomach, or lungs) may be made of energy.
	¥¥¥ A large external part, such as an entire arm or leg, part of the
	torso, etc. can be made of energy.  The mutant's entire range of torso-
	oriented internal organs, if desired, may be composed of energy.   The
	mutant's brain is another possible energy part, and so is the head. The
	blood or immune system may also be composed of energy.  Normal weapons
	lose five dice from their damage pools.  Brawling attacks do three
	extra dice of damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Both arms or legs, wings, etc. can be made of energy.  Normal
	weapons lose six dice from their damage pools. Brawling attacks do four
	extra dice of damage.  The mutant's entire nervous system (brain,
	spinal cord, nerves) or skeletal system may be composed of energy.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The entire body south of the neck, if desired.  Normal weapons
	lose seven dice from their damage pools.  Brawling attacks do five
	extra dice of damage.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Shift Form [AL]- the mutant can switch on and off his energy body part.
	¥¥¥ Kamikaze Burst- the mutant can sacrifice Health Levels in order to
	increase the power of his body parts (one Health Level per die added to
	the damage pool).  This damage can be soaked, but the effort is
	exhausting.
	
	Specific stunts related to particular parts (such as energy vision
	developed from having an energy eye) may also be developed.

Energy Boosting Field (Social) [AL]
	An unusual counterpart to the Energy Dampening Field; this Power
	intensifies most energy types within a limited range, whether they are
	naturally occuring or created by mutants.  It does not affect gravitic
	energy or gross kinetic energy.  Energy that originates outside the
	field will be amplified while it occupies the field (that is to say, it
	is intensified within the field, but returns to its normal level of
	power as it exits the area of effect).  Energy that originates inside
	the field remains at the boosted intensity.  Roll Charisma + EBF to
	activate (difficulty 6).
	
	Note that if a mutant generating energy stands within the field, he may
	suffer from feedback if it is boosted too high.  If the effective Rank
	of the energy he emits is increased beyond his Power Potential, the
	mutant must soak one Health Level of damage for every Rank by which it
	is exceeded (diff 7).
	
	A mutant who uses this Power to boost his own energy emissions must be
	even more careful-- he must soak damage in the same way if the
	effective Rank is higher than his current Power Charge (or Power
	Potential, if his Power Charge somehow exceeds it).
	
	Note that double-cost energy types are boosted at half-rate (that is,
	it takes Rank ¥¥ of this Power to boost Balefire or Hard Radiation by
	one effective Rank, and Rank ¥¥¥¥ to boost them by two effective
	Ranks).
	
	¥ The range of the field is ten feet. All energy is amplified by one
	effective Rank (NOT one Health Level!)
	¥¥ Energy is amplified by two effective Ranks within ten feet, and one
	Rank between ten and twenty feet.
	¥¥¥ Energy is amplified by three ranks within ten feet of the mutant,
	two Ranks between ten and twenty feet, and one Rank between twenty and
	thirty feet.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is forty feet, with energy being amplified by four Ranks
	within ten feet, and decreasing by one Rank of intensity for every ten
	additional feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range is fifty feet. Energy is amplified by five effective
	Ranks within ten feet, decreasing by one Rank of intensity for every
	ten additional feet.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Energy Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Power: Energy
	Resistance with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Filter Out - the mutant can chose to only affect energy types of
	her/his choosing.
	¥¥¥¥ Shape field- the volume of the field remains unchanged, but the
	mutant may otherwise change the shape of the field from a sphere into
	something more useful.  This requires light concentration.

Energy Channeling (Social) [AL]
	Rather than release energy "in the raw", this power allows a mutant
	to imbue objects (usually inorganic ones) with this energy, which
	can have a variety of effects.  Gambit's power is a form of Energy
	Channeling (Kinetic), while Iceman demonstrated in Legionquest that
	he can do Energy Channeling (Cold) even on living beings.  No roll
	is required to channel the energy, though Gambit needs a Dexterity +
	Missiles roll to hit his target with his charged cards.  While
	the variety of energy channeled will largely determine the effects
	of this power and its possible Power Stunts, there are a few
	commonalities:
	
	* An object can absorb one full charge (that is, the maximum amount
	of energy that the mutant can put out in one round) per Health Level
	that it possesses.  Thus, Gambit's playing cards can hold one charge,
	while the Phalanx that he charged could have held seven charges or
	more.  This is not to say that a mutant with Energy Channeling ¥
	could charge a playing card five times because a character with
	Energy Channeling ¥¥¥¥¥ can store a charge with five times the
	concussive power in it.  Rather, both mutants force roughly the
	same amount of power into the card, but the mutant with the higher
	Rank can get more of it to stick.  Any further attempts on the part
	of the low-level mutant to charge the card will still cause it to
	explode, since the amount he's trying to force in PLUS the small
	amount that is already in the card are too much to coexist in an
	item with only one Health Level, even for an instant.
	
	* These charges dissipate at the rate of one die from the damage
	dice pool per round, until they are drained.
	
	* Any attempt to 'over-charge' an object will force it to burst,
	releasing all the energy that it had absorbed.
	
	Special Flaw: One Medium (2 points)- the mutant can only channel
	energy through one particular kind of matter, be it water, flesh, or
	iron.  The X-Treme can only channel through blood.

	¥ One die of damage
	¥¥ Two dice of damage
	¥¥¥ Three dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice of damage
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen dice of damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen dice of damage

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Radiate Light- if the mutant's energy seems to be appropriate to the
	task, he may choose to charge an object just enough to radiate light-
	up to 60 w. is possible without a violent charge.
	¥ Strengthening (Kinetic Energy Channeling)- as for matter hardening
	ranks, one for one. The energy dissipates at the rate of one rank of
	hardness per two rounds.
	¥¥¥ Flesh Channeling- this Stunt allows the mutant to channel energy
	through living tissue as well as inorganic material.
	¥¥¥¥ Consumption- the charged object implodes, cracks, and may even
	crumble into dust.  In other words, it takes all of the damage from the
	charge, and does not damage the surrounding area.
	¥¥¥¥ Remote Control- this Stunt allows the mutant to channel energy
	into an object without actually touching it.  This may be how the
	X-Treme performs his famous 'burn'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Drain Charge- the mutant may actually absorb energy of his type
	through a medium by touch and dissipate it harmlessly.  This does not
	apply to energy blasts.

Energy Control (Social) [AL]
	Again, this is one of the most common and envied powers among mutants,
	because it can lead be harnessed to do some great tricks.  This power,
	like Telepathy, is practically made for power stunts because there are
	just so many things you can do with energy.  Most of the time, this 
	power goes hand-in-hand with energy emission, but there have been some
	notable exceptions to this rule (such as Pyro, before he got the legacy
	virus).  See the Energy List for possible target energies.
	
	Each success on a Wits + Energy Control (diff 6) test allows one or more 
	of these effects:
	- the damage potential of an appropriate energy burst may be raised or
	lowered by one die
	- an energy burst can be made to change directions if the accumulated
	successes of the mutant exceed the Energy Control successes of the
	source of the energy
	- an energy burst may be reshaped into something more useful to the
	mutant (such as a forcefield) if the necessary number of successes are
	acquired.
	
	Note that even if the mutant himself is the source of the energy being
	manipulated, he still needs at least the same number of successes to
	manipulate ALL of the energy he released.  However, the difficulty to
	control one's own energy is at -2.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Energy Perception- the mutant may, on a Per + Energy Control roll, 
	detect the presence of his type of energy, or even see it (in the 
	case of otherwise invisible E-M radiation).
	¥ Energy Soak- the mutant may use his power rank to help soak the
	energy of his type, even without conscious effort.  This is in addition
	to any conscious manipulation made.
	¥¥ Carrier Wave- the mutant may use his energy to propel him.  This
	works as per Flight ¥.  Alternately, the mutant has the option to buy
	the Flight Power with Experience.
	¥¥ Energy field- One extra soak die per success on a Wits + Energy Control 
	roll.  This field may inflict damage on people who attempt to fight
	hand-to-hand with the mutant.
	¥¥¥ Channeling- A character with energy control powers can buy Energy
	Channeling with experience points even if he didn't start out with it,
	once he buys this power stunt.  This energy channeling must be of a type
	that he can control already.
	¥¥¥ Emission- A character with energy control powers can buy Energy
	Emission with experience points even if he didn't start out with it,
	once he buys this power stunt.  This energy emission must be of a type
	that he can control already.

Energy Dampening Field (Social) [AN]
	This Power causes the mutant to radiate a field in which high-intensity
	energy is dampened to lower levels.  It operates in much the same
	respect as Power Dampening, subtracting effective Ranks from any energy
	that exists in its bounds, to a minimum level of zero Ranks (not enough
	to damage anyone or have any secondary effects).  It will not just
	dampen energies created by mutants; it will also 'turn down' the dial
	on lightning and other naturally occurring energy sources.  This Power
	is involuntary and does not require a roll; in strange circumstances,
	use Stamina + EDF.  If energy enters the field from outside, it is
	dampened as well, but only to the extent that it enters the field.
	
	*Note- this Power does not dampen gross kinetic energy, so it is only
	marginally effective against Energy Force (half effect or less).  It
	functions normally against Heat and Flame attacks.
	
	¥ The range of the dampening effect is ten feet.  All energy in its
	range is dampened by one effective Rank (NOT one Health Level!)
	¥¥ The range is fifteen feet.  Energy is dampened by two effective
	Ranks.
	¥¥¥ The range is twenty feet.  Energy is dampened by three effective
	Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is twenty-five feet.  Energy is dampened by four
	effective Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range is thirty feet.  Energy is dampened by five effective
	Ranks.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Super-charged dampening field dampens energy by six effective
	Ranks and drains a point of Power Charge from anyone foolish enough to
	use an Energy Power in the environs.  The range is fifty feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The range is 100 feet.  Energy is dampened by seven effective
	Ranks.  A point of Power Charge and a point of Willpower are drained.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The range is 200 feet.  Energy is dampened by eight effective
	Ranks.  Two points of Power Charge and Willpower are drained.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The range is 500 feet.  Energy is dampened by nine effective
	Ranks.  Three points of Power Charge and Willpower are drained.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The range is a mile.  Energy is dampened by ten effective
	Ranks.  Four points of Power Charge and Willpower are drained.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Off Switch- the mutant can shut off the EDF with a Stamina + EDF
	roll (diff 6) and keep it off with light concentration.
	¥¥¥ Filter out- the mutant can choose to dampen only specific kinds of
	energy (excluding as many types from being dampened as he gets on a
	Manipulation + EDF roll, difficulty 7).
	¥¥¥¥ Shape field- the volume of the field remains unchanged, but the
	mutant may otherwise change the shape of the field from a sphere into
	something more useful.  This requires light concentration.

Energy Emission (Social) [AL]
	This is one of the most common and sought-after powers that a mutant
	can have.  Many of Magneto's powers would qualify as energy emission;
	as do the powers of Cyclops and Havok.  The big difference between
	Magneto and the Summers brothers is the Energy Control power, which
	does not necessarily complement this ability.  The mutant either
	creates this energy from his own body processes (Cyclops) or sucks
	some ambient energy out of his surroundings (Havok).  There are any
	number of possible energy emission powers- see the Energy List.

	The attack roll (Dex + Directed Blast), if it is successful, allows
	for a damage test equal to two dice for every Rank in Energy Emission,
	if appropriate.  The difficulty to soak is based on the kind of energy
	involved, and other situational factors.  There is also the question
	of collateral damage.

	Most of the time, the mutant will not use his full damage pool to
	attack with, since that would constitute lethal force.  He may elect
	to leave some of his dice on the table when rolling damage.

	Variation: Beam- Rather than fire a single burst of energy, a mutant
	with this variation emits it as a constant beam.  Dodge and Evasion
	rolls require one extra success in order to avoid this attack.  It is
	also capable of being maintained.  Each turn after the first, the
	mutant may spend a point of Willpower to maintain her attack.  No roll
	is required to continue the emission; targets must, however, make a new
	roll to try and remove themselves from the path of the beam.  For two
	points of Willpower, the beam may be "swept," striking multiple targets
	for half damage (one roll to hit will apply to several targets-- each
	victim after the first has his difficulty to dodge or evade reduced by
	one).  The maximum number of targets that may be struck in this was is
	equal the mutant's rank in Energy Emission.  Since it's a rather
	indiscriminate attack, any friendlies should be well away from the line
	of fire before trying this one.  This variation costs 3 extra freebie
	points (or experience points) initially, and three extra experience
	points per Rank.

	Special Merit: Odd Variance (4 point Merit): For whatever reason,
	the mutant's version of the energy is slightly different than the
	kind everyone else has, which makes it harder to resist.  Treat any
	automatic soak against it as extra dice, instead, and mutants with
	Energy Absorption/Conversion have to roll one die per Rank to absorb
	it, rather than absorbing it automatically.

	Special Flaw: Full Tilt (1 point Flaw): The mutant cannot vary the
	amount of energy he emits; it is always a full-strength blast for him.
	Havok has this Flaw when he is not wearing his new equipment.

	Special Flaw: Slow Buildup (2 or 4 point Flaw): The mutant cannot
	store the energy that his body gathers or creates for very long; it
	must be released periodically.  In combination with the flaw Full
	Tilt, this can be really irritating.  The mutant must release a blast
	of energy of at least one damage die potential per hour- he can let it
	build up to his Power Rank in damage potential, but then it will be
	released involuntarily.  Havok has this Flaw when he is not wearing a
	special suit.  Alternately, the mutant can only build up one level of
	damage potential per round- thus, more damaging blasts can only be
	made if the mutant waits for a bit.  For four points, the mutant
	suffers both of these effects.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Light- Most energy emission powers produce a dim light- this is just
	a sustained, controlled low-level emission.
	¥ Resistance to energy- this is an automatic soak success against the
	kind of energy that you can emit.  Each point of emission= two automatic
	soak successes.  Thus, Polaris (Energy Emission Magnetism ¥¥¥) gets six
	automatic soak successes against an attack by Magneto (Energy Emission
	Magnetism ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥), but frankly is still in a heap o' trouble.
	¥¥ Energy Fist- the mutant can surround his body with the energy he
	emits to add to his brawling damage.  Adds one Health Level of damage
	per success.  Requires the Stunt: Resistance to Energy and a successful
	damage test.
	¥¥ Knockback- requires Kinetic Energy Emission.  The target is struck
	by the energy and blasted backwards; typically, this inflicts no damage
	unless the target strikes something in the course of its flight.  The
	damage pool for the blast is used as the Strength score for this
	purpose.
	¥¥¥ Channeling- a mutant with energy emission powers can buy channeling
	with experience points, even if he didn't start with this ability, once
	he buys this power stunt.  This channeling must be of a sort of energy
	that he can already emit.
	¥¥¥ Control- a mutant with energy emission powers can buy energy control
	with experience points, even if he didn't start with this ability, once
	he buys this power stunt.  This control must be over a sort of energy
	that he can already emit.
	¥¥¥ Kamikaze Blast- the mutant can add a health level of damage to his
	attack for every health level he takes (this is soakable)- this will
	likely render the mutant unconscious from the effort.  (Three Willpower
	successes are required to avoid).  No roll is required.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Energy Healing- when exposed to the kind of energy that the mutant
	emits, he can make a Stamina + Emission roll, difficulty 9, to use that
	energy to heal wound levels.  This cannot be self-generated energy (that
	would be like drawing blood out of your left arm to transfuse into your
	right arm), but can be the energy of another mutant with this power or
	of naturally occurring phenomena.
	
	Energy Emission/Energy Control Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥¥ Multitargeting- the mutant spends one turn aiming, and the next
	she can split her damage pool, using the same hit roll for all attacks.
	¥¥¥/¥¥ Chainbolt- the mutant can create a blast that 'jumps' from
	target to target, damaging each in turn.  The mutant may choose to
	split her Dex + Directed blast roll to effect the jumps in one round,
	or may make the jumps over a series of rounds.  In any case, the 
	blast loses one die out of its damage pool per point of Stamina that
	each target has after striking it (thus, losing one die after striking
	a tottering old granny, eight dice after striking Wolverine).
	¥¥¥/¥¥¥ Homing Missile- if the target dodges an attack, it boomerangs
	and will attack again the following round (and again in the round
	following) «til it hits. The mutant only needs to roll to hit one time
	for every attack but for every round the emission misses, the damage
	pool is decreased.

Energy Forging (Social) [AL]
	The ability to shape energy of some kind into a solid object is not
	unknown in the comic world; it is the basis of the Green Lantern's
	powers.  This object is not permanent, and still retains the basic
	characteristics of the energy that created it, but has been altered to
	give it a certain solidity.  If the mutant has an Energy Emission
	Power of some kind, then he can use that energy; otherwise, he will
	have to rely on ambient energy.  Unless the energy is gravitic, the
	objects forged by this power will typically have little or no weight.
	Typically, objects cannot have moving parts, but separate components
	can be created as separate objects to create a composite with such
	capabilities.  This requires a Dexterity + Energy Forging roll,
	difficulty relating to the complexity of the object.
	
	¥ Objects created are brittle and shatter after taking two Health
	Levels of damage.  The size of the object is limited to one cubic
	foot in volume.
	¥¥ Objects have four Health Levels.  Up to eight cubic feet.
	¥¥¥ Objects have six Health Levels.  Up to 27 cubic feet.
	¥¥¥¥ Objects have eight Health Levels.  Up to 64 cubic feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Objects have ten Health Levels.  Up to 125 cubic feet.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Weapon forging- the mutant can create melee or missile weapons
	out of the energy, which do standard damage (and possibly some
	collateral damage).

Energy Resistance (Physical/Social) [PN]
	This is a very basic power.  The mutant receives one automatic soak
	success vs. energy attacks for every Rank he has in this power.  A
	mutant can purchase a Resistance to a specific form of energy for half
	of the experience or Freebie point cost, rather than buying the full
	version of this Power.  The Thing, for instance, has Energy Resistance
	(Fire).  Furthermore, all energy is only difficulty 6 to soak,
	regardless of the usual value (if the energy CAN be soaked, that is). 
	The damage from any energy attack is considered to be lethal, rather
	than aggravated, by a mutant with full Energy Resistance.  This Power
	does not protect against magic or kinetic energy, and only offers
	extra dice of protection (rather than auto-soaks) against energy 
	force.
	
	¥ One automatic soak vs. energy
	¥¥ Two automatic soak vs. energy
	¥¥¥ Three automatic soak vs. energy
	¥¥¥¥ Four automatic soak vs. energy
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five automatic soak vs. energy
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Five automatic soak vs. energy, plus the mutant's Health is
	actually recharged by one Level, and a sixth point of damage is
	absorbed thereby.  No sixth point, no health.  Double-cost energy
	types do not recharge health in this way, and neither does cold or
	nether, unless a specific resistance is taken.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Up to two Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Up to three Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Up to four Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to five Health Levels
	
	* Specific Resistances- if the mutant takes the specific resistance
	for some forms of energy (for half cost, as noted above), there can
	be some secondary advantages conferred upon the mutant.  For example:
	
	Balefire Resistance- the mutant can use his Balefire Resistance
	dice to resist any corrupting- or Wyrm-energy attack of any kind,
	including Bane powers and the Dark Reward Power Stunt of the Voice
	of Command.
	
	Cold Resistance- the mutant is immune to direct applications of 
	Pyrokinesis and Cryokinesis.
	
	Darkforce Resistance- the mutant can use his Darkforce Resistance
	dice to soak Life Force draining attacks of any sort.
	
	Electrical Resistance- the mutant is immune to Physical Possession,
	the 'Perfect Alignment' stunt for Mass-Shifting, Puppetry, and any
	other effect which controls using an interface with the mutant's
	nerves.
	
	Energy Force Resistance- the mutant gets auto-soaks instead of extra
	dice vs. energy force, and one extra die/two Ranks (rounding down) to
	soak straight kinetic attacks.
	
	Fire Resistance- the mutant may purchase Heat Resistance and Plasma
	Resistance with Experience.
	
	Gravitic Resistance- the mutant may use his auto-soaks to cancel
	Weight-Shifting, Aggressive Mass-shifting, or the effects of Phasing
	Aisle.  Mutant may purchase the Power: Flight with Experience.
	
	Hard Radiation Resistance- short-wave radiation, like the x-rays, do
	not pass through any portion of your body.  They are reflected by the
	skin. This means that you cannot be x-rayed, and are immune to the
	deleterious side-effects of hard radiation.

	Heat Resistance- the mutant is immune to direct applications of 
	Pyrokinesis and Cryokinesis.
	
	Light Resistance- the mutant gets an Intelligence check to recognize
	any light-based illusions (such as holograms, or some such created by
	the Illusion Casting Power).
	
	Nether Resistance- the mutant may resist Energy Subtraction or the
	effects of Energy Vampirism by counting his auto-soaks against his 
	opponent's successes.
	
	Nexus Resistance- the mutant can use his Nexus Resistance dice
	to soak any aging attack, time travel effect, or space-warping effect
	(including Correspondence Magick and teleportation).
	
	Nullfire Resistance- the mutant may use his Nullfire Resistance dice
	to soak vs. other reality-altering effects such as Chaos Field, Hex
	Power, or Distortion Beam.
	
	Plasma Resistance- the mutant may purchase Fire Resistance and Heat
	Resistance with Experience.
	
	Purifying Light Resistance- the mutant can use his Purifying
	Light Resistance dice to resist confidence-sapping attacks of any 
	kind, including certain applications of the Projective Empathy Power
	and the Werewolf Gift: Snarl of the Predator.
	
	Radio Wave Resistance- your mutant is undetectable by radar, and 
	may purchase the Power: Psychic Invulnerability with Experience.
	
	X-Ray Resistance- short-wave radiation, like the x-rays, do not pass
	through any portion of your body.  They are reflected by the skin. 
	This means that you cannot be x-rayed, and are immune to the
	deleterious side-effects of hard radiation.

Energy Sheath (Social) [AL]
	Like the Human Torch, your mutant has the power to cloak herself in a
	particular kind of energy, which provides protection from many forms
	of attack, and can itself be used as a weapon.  It is less potent, in
	some ways, than Energy Body, but considerably safer in others.  A
	simple Stamina + Energy Sheath roll (diff 4) is required to 'flame
	on'.

	¥ The mutant gets two automatic soak successes against energy of her
	type, and a separate damage pool (two dice) for energy damage when she
	engages in brawling or martial arts attacks.  Some conventional
	attacks may suffer when they come into contact with the energy sheath
	(bullets tend to melt when they meet a fire sheath, for instance).  In
	such cases, the mutant is considered to have an automatic success to
	'block' or 'parry' against such attacks, even if he does not take an
	action to do so.  If the energy type is double cost, then the sheath
	provides double the protection.
	¥¥ Four automatic soak against the mutant's energy type, four damage
	pool for brawling, two or four successes against certain attacks.
	¥¥¥ Six automatic soak, six damage pool, three or six successes.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight automatic soak, eight damage pool, four or eight successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten automatic soak, ten damage pool, five or ten successes.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Emission- the mutant may purchase the Energy Emission Power (with
	the energy of her type) with Experience.
	¥¥ Flight- if the mutant's power is an appropriate sort (Heat Sheath,
	for instance) he can use it to fly with a Dexterity + Flight roll. 
	Flight is a Skill.
	¥¥ Tone Down- the mutant may contract the sheath so as to restrict the
	damage he does to people in close quarters.

Energy Subtraction (Social) [AL]
	Like Elijah Snow of Planetary, your mutant can nullify a certain energy
	type.  The mutant can actively drain even ambient amounts of such
	energy from her surroundings.  This allows the mutant to nullify energy
	attacks that do not even target her (roll Manipulation + Energy
	Subtraction, diff 6).  If use of this Power causes damage (such as
	subtracting heat from a human body might) use the same damage rules as
	per Energy Emission.  
	
	¥ The mutant can nullify one Rank of energy.  The range is 50 feet.
	¥¥ Two Ranks at 50 feet, or one at 100 feet.
	¥¥¥ Three Ranks at 50 feet, two at 100, one at 150.  
	¥¥¥¥ Four Ranks at 50 feet, three at 100, two at 150, one at 200.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Ranks at 50 feet, four at 100, three at 150, two at 200,
	one at 250.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Channeling- the mutant may purchase a special 'subtractive'
	version of Energy Channeling, using the opposing energy-- Elijah
	Snow, with Energy Subtraction (Heat) could develop Energy Channeling
	(Cold).

Energy Transformation* (Social) [AH]
	This power, related to but more robust than Energy Absorption/
	Conversion, allows your character to transform one form of energy into
	another.  Energy Transformation functions to the limit of the mutant's
	perceptual range, and neither the source nor the destination of the
	energy is important for the purposes of the transformation.  The
	momentum of the transformed energy does not change, except to the
	extent that it interacts with the environment differently than it did
	in its previous state.  For example, a blast of radio waves moves
	more efficiently through water than heat or darkforce.
	
	There is the possibility, if some but not all of an energy stream is
	transformed, that it will interact with the remainder.  Cold and heat
	sprays will tend to cancel each other, for example.  So will balefire
	and purifying light.  The system is Charisma + Energy Transformation
	(difficulty equal to the soak difficulty for the energy).  This can
	be hugely damaging for a target with Energy Body-- soak one Health 
	Level of damage per Rank cancelled (thus, two ranks of Energy Body:
	Cold being transformed into two ranks of Heat could cause up to four
	Health Levels of damage, assuming that the victim had Energy Body at
	Rank four or higher to begin with).  A mutant with Energy Body or
	Energy Control can directly oppose attempts to transform 'his'
	energy (diff 6 Charisma + Energy Control roll, or diff 8 Stamina +
	Energy Body roll).
	
	Special Flaw: Monotype Transfer (2 or 3 pts.)- the mutant can either
	transform only one type of energy (see the energy list) or to only
	one type of energy for two points.  For three points, both of these
	restrictions apply.
	
	¥ Two damage dice worth of energy may be transformed.  Note that
	double-cost energy types (such as balefire) are worth double-- it
	would take two Ranks of Energy Transformation to change one Rank of
	balefire, and there is a 50% loss when transforming a single-cost
	energy type to balefire.
	¥¥ Four dice
	¥¥¥ Six dice
	¥¥¥¥ Eight dice
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten dice
	
Energy Vampirism (Social) [PL]
	This power can turn your mutant into a hunter of other mutants (and
	wall sockets!).  Basically, your character automatically converts
	energy attacks into Health.  He does not need to eat.  However, he
	automatically loses one Health Level per day!  Therefore, you've got
	to get out there and absorb that energy.  Your mutant can always
	absorb excess energy- it is good to learn the Store Energy Power
	Stunt so you have a few "bagged lunches" handy.  You cannot absorb
	your own energy to nourish yourself.  This does not require any
	kind of roll.
	
	Special Flaw: Rarefied Tastes (1-3 point Flaw)- the mutant can only be
	nourished by one particular type of energy, be it electricity or beta
	radiation.  The relative rarity of the energy can make this a one, two,
	or three-point flaw.  Other kinds of energy can be absorbed, but they
	dissipate without benefit.
	
	¥ One Health Level of energy can be absorbed per action.
	¥¥ Two Health Levels can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥ Three Health Levels can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels can be absorbed.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen Health Levels
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- your mutant can store an amount of energy in Health
	Levels equal to his Power Rank.
	¥¥¥ Lights out- a mutant with Energy Body can be forced back into
	his normal human form if the Energy Vampire makes a successful
	hit.
	¥¥¥¥ Energy Vacuum- by making a Charisma + Energy Vampirism roll,
	the mutant can 'call' energy to himself as an action.  In this wise,
	he can pull an energy strike away from its intended target and
	absorb the energy himself.  He must garner more successes for more
	distant energy streams (ST's discretion).

Energy Weaponry (Social) [AL]
	The mutant is able, through the use of this power, to create a weapon
	(either for Melee, Firearms, or Missiles use) that is composed of
	energy.  This weapon has no solidity to it, (unless it is an Energy
	Force or Kinetic Force weapon) relying instead on the type of energy
	it is to inflict damage.  Pick an energy type from the Energy List
	above.  The difficulty to hit is always 6.  Energy Weapons, of course,
	cannot be parried under most circumstances.
	
	¥ Weapon inflicts Dexterity + 1 Health Levels of damage, if a melee
	weapon, or 2 Levels if a ranged weapon.
	¥¥ Weapon inflicts Dex + 2 or 3 damage.
	¥¥¥ Weapon does Dex + 3 or 4 damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Weapon does Dex + 4 or 5 damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Weapon does Dex + 5 or 6 damage.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Solid- the weapon has a certain solidity to it (though this does
	not enhance its damage capability) and can thus be used to parry.

Enhanced Accuracy [Crack Shot] (Physical) [AN]
	This deadly power makes any object in a mutant's hand a potentially
	lethal throwing weapon, and any gun an appalling source of pain and
	destruction.  The mutant gets an intuitive feel for the wind and
	air pressure and the shape and weight of the object.  The mutant will
	almost never miss a target, and can usually pick the area of maximum
	effect for impact.  These successes only apply to the hit roll, but
	since the number of successes on that roll translate to extra dice for
	the damage test, this does not matter much.  Bullseye has this power,
	as does Boomerang.
	
	¥ One automatic Missiles, Archery, and Firearms success, rated at
	difficulty 7, plus the ability to raise those skills to six with
	experience.
	¥¥ Two successes (at diff 7), max skill level seven.
	¥¥¥ Three successes (two sevens and an eight), max skill level eight.
	¥¥¥¥ Four successes (one seven, two eights, one nine), max skill level
	nine.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five successes (two eights, two nines, one ten), max skill level
	ten.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥¥ The Quick and the Dead- Requires the Power: Heightened Reflexes. 
	The mutant may increase the rate of fire of all missile (including
	thrown) weapons by one per two ranks of Enhanced Accuracy and
	Heightened Reflexes (rate of fire increases to two shots/round at
	Rank ¥¥/¥¥, and three shots/round at ¥¥¥¥/¥¥¥¥).
	¥¥¥ Atemi- the mutant can detect structural weak points in a target
	and use them to bring it down.  This only works on inorganic objects,
	but a Perception + Enhanced Accuracy roll gives one automatic success 
	for damage tests vs. that object.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Saint of Killers- The mutant may, with the expenditure of a point
	of Power Charge, double her damage pool for any one missile weapon
	attack.  Use of this stunt must be declared before the attack is made,
	and the Charge is still spent, even if the projectile misses.  This
	Stunt does not work with Firearms.

Entrapment (Physical) [AL]
	This really weird power has a few variations, but essentially they are
	all the same- the mutant can trap man-sized things in his own body.
	This can either be partial or full entrapment, and it varies in the ease
	of escape.  The Blob, Mondo, and Abyss all have this power, though the
	Blob's is the most ineffective (and disgusting) of the three.  The mutant
	must first successfully grapple the victim, (the Elastic Body Power is
	great for this) then a successful Dex + Brawl roll will mean that the
	victim is entrapped.  The victim must be smaller than the mutant, unless
	the mutant has some sort of extradimensional space (like Abyss) to hold
	his victims in.
	
	Variation: External Source*- at double cost, the mutant does not use
	his own body to trap others, but a form of matter or energy (choose
	from the energy list or as per Matter Control).  In additional to
	holding the victim with the listed Strength, the hold will inflict
	damage every round equal to the mutant's Rank in Entrapment plus one.
	The mutant may emit the energy if she uses Darkforce, for example, but
	if she uses matter, it must be present in the area.  An amount adequate
	in volume to hold the victim will move under the mutant's command.
	
	¥ The mutant can hold his victims with a Strength of 2 without heavy 
	strain or concentration.
	¥¥ The hold is at a Strength of 4.
	¥¥¥ Strength 6
	¥¥¥¥ Strength 8
	¥¥¥¥¥ Strength 10
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Strength 12
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Strength 14
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Strength 16
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Strength 18
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Strength 20

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Concentrated hold- the mutant can concentrate and add his own
	Strength to the hold strength in order to keep a captive in line.
	¥¥ Suffocation- the mutant can tighten the captive's bonds in order
	to suffocate her.  Normal choking rules apply.
	¥¥¥ Digest Victim- while the victim is held inside, the mutant can
	make contested Willpower checks, and use one of the victim's powers
	once if he succeeds.  The victim will slowly be "digested" in a
	matter of days (the number of days is equal to the victim's Stamina)
	at which point the victim starts losing a Health Level per day until
	he dies.
	¥¥¥¥ Extradimensional Space- the victim is stuck in a sort of limbo
	which can be much larger than the mutant's insides.
	¥¥¥¥ Host Body- Requires Digest Victim.  Much like Dirt Nap, the
	mutant takes on the appearance of the victim, as well as any
	Physical Attributes and powers.  This lasts until the victim is
	digested.  May also require Extradimensional Space in practice.

Exorcism (Mental) [AH]
	Any psychic invasion, bond, or other spiritual/psychic 'foreign matter'
	can be expelled from a subject (including the Power holder) using this
	ability.  Jean Grey and Dr. Strange have shown that they are capable
	of performing this function.  Domination, Vampiric Blood Bonds, and
	Puppetry of all sorts can be cancelled through Exorcism.  An exorcism
	requires the expenditure of as many Willpower points as the invader
	originally had successes (three for any Blood Bond).  The system is
	typically Charisma + Exorcism (diff 6), though this is only necessary
	in the case of contested exorcisms.
	
	¥ Rank one psychic/spiritual effects can be cancelled, including
	Skinriding.
	¥¥ Rank two effects can be cancelled.
	¥¥¥ Rank three effects can be cancelled, including the Blood Bond.
	¥¥¥¥ Rank four effects can be cancelled.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Rank five effects can be cancelled.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Ego Manipulation- an Exorcist can affect victims with Alter Ego
	with this stunt, though an expulsion merely puts a personality to
	sleep, rather than removing it.  He may also attempt to expel a
	Psychic Template; this destroys the template personality.
	¥¥ Forbiddance- the mutant can 'keep out' a psychic invader using
	a contested Willpower roll if she knows that an assault is taking
	place.
	¥¥¥¥ Calm Frenzy- the mutant may calm another mutant in some kind
	of frenzy (diff 6) or attempt the same trick on a vampire (diff 7)
	or a werewolf (diff 8).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Break Enchantment- if a person has been Enchanted by a
	changeling or fae, that effect can be broken (diff 7).

Explosive Force Generation (Social) [AL]
	Like Jubilee or Meltdown (Boomer, Boom-Boom, Tabitha, whatever), you
	can create pyrotechnic, explosive force at will.  Combining kinetic
	energy, heat, and light in a particularly violent manner, this Power
	can rip and shred much more effectively than a steady force of an
	equivalent strength.  For every Rank, this Power has two dice in its
	damage pool.  Furthermore, every '9' or '10' rolled shreds a point of
	armour (including soak dice for regular Stamina).  A normal Dex +
	Directed Blast roll is required to hit.
	
	Variation: Time Bomb- Like Tabitha, this variation allows a mutant to
	release the force as light (in globes or a stream), and decide just
	when it is going to explode.  This costs 2 Freebie points.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ In the Mix- the mutant can vary the mixture of heat, light, and
	force in her blasts (perhaps making a pretty light show or a
	harmless sonic boom-- or to avoid setting off an opponent's particular
	defensive Powers).  This is a Manipulation + Explosive Force roll
	(taking an action or splitting the dice pool to change the 'mix'),
	difficulty 6, and every two successes allows the mutant to shift what
	is otherwise an equal proportion slightly-- from 1/3 each to 1/4
	force and 3/8 heat and light, or 1/4 force, 1/2 light, 1/4 heat, etc.
	¥¥ Flash-Bang- requires In the Mix.  The mutant can use a relatively
	harmless mixture to overload the senses of a victim (without necessarily
	causing damage).  This requires four successes on a Manipulation +
	Explosive Force roll (diff 6).  Perception difficulties are increased
	by two for victims because of the brilliant light and noise (or by four 
	for people with the appropriate Heightened Senses).
	¥¥¥ Flight- it's a pretty insane way of flying, but Sam Guthrie uses
	this power to do so.  The mutant can achieve speeds of 20 mph for
	every Rank in this Power.
	¥¥¥¥ Explosive Sheath [AH]- requiring heavy concentration, this Stunt
	surrounds the character in energy just waiting to explode.  Whenever
	the mutant strikes (or is struck) by an object weighing at least an
	ounce (roughly a thirty-fifth part of a kilogram), the sheath detonates
	and releases damage in the direction of the object.  Several 
	simultaneous strikes will cause simultaneous releases of this kind,
	all for full damage.  Unfortunately, when the mutant chooses to
	release this sheath, it will detonate, causing full damage to anything
	within a certain distance of the mutant (five feet/Rank).

Extra Body Parts (Physical) [PN]
	Not every mutant looks like a normal human- Nightcrawler, for instance,
	has a tail.  Spiral (though she is an alien and thus a bad example) has
	four extra arms.  The Wings power is separate, though related to this
	power.  These body parts have a variety of functions, which depend
	largely on the form they take.  The mutant will probably end up with
	the 2-point Flaw: Monstrous Appearance.  No roll is required.
	
	Sample Body Parts:
	¥ Eye- a third eye, when placed on the head or somewhere else where it
	can line up with the first two, subtracts one from all Firearms and
	Missiles difficulties.  You could have an eye on the back of your head,
	though it would have pretty crappy depth perception unless you bought
	another one.  A power stunt (Visual Processing) allows you to have
	both sets open at once without confusing your visual fields.
	¥ Fur- all difficulties to soak cold attacks are one less; you can
	survive great extremes of cold temperature.  An especially shaggy coat,
	while it can reduce difficulties to soak cold further (one per dot),
	also increase the difficulty of soaking heat attacks.
	¥ Hair (prehensile)- of some usefulness, but a bit strange. It has a
	Strength of 1 unless you spend more points on its Rank, in which case
	you can have any Strength you can afford. The hairs can be divided or
	work together but only together can it use its full strength.  One hair
	has the strength to wisp dust or tie a knot on itself but not much
	more.
	¥ Leg- not quite as useful unless bought in pairs.  With four legs, your
	running speed increases by half and you become exceedingly difficult to
	trip.  On the other hand, you're going to spend a fortune on pants.
	¥ Semicircular Canals- you've got a back-up system for your sense of
	balance.  An extra set of canals subtracts one botch from all rolls
	for Dodging, Acrobatics, and other skills that require balance.
	¥ Tail- this is simply a swishing tail.  It can be made fully prehensile
	at the expense of purchasing a Power Stunt at character creation.  It has
	a maximum Strength of 1, except at the expense of purchasing an extra dot
	for it (a Tail ¥¥ would have a Strength of 2.)
	¥ Tentacle- useful, but a bit repulsive.  A tentacle is automatically
	prehensile, but not very socially acceptable.  It has a Strength of 1
	unless you spend more points on its Rank, in which case you can have
	any Strength you can afford.
	¥¥ Arm- an extra arm is a useful item to have.  Now you can hold your
	drink while you type!  Extra attacks are possible with a split dice pool
	and the ambidexterity merit applies to all arms.  Sweet.
	¥¥ Fingers- the mutant may either have a double set of fingers on each
	hand (two palms, or just a really broad hand), or an extra set of five
	finger-like appendices anywhere on the body.
	¥¥ Heart- your ticker can be stopped by some smart-alec with a gun or
	TK, but a back-up lets you keep on going.  Heart attacks are unlikely
	to damage you much if you've got an extra.
	¥¥¥ Head- you may or may not get two brains (you'd have to buy another)
	but you'd get two sets of sensory organs and two necks.  No end of
	uses for this one.
	¥¥¥ Brain- how can you go wrong?  Your brains automatically receive
	the power Psychic Link (with each other), and know what the other is
	doing at all times.  Basically, you get two actions per round (as your
	body permits, that is) without splitting your dice pool.  Psychic
	control is difficult to establish over a fellow with two brains.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Retractable- OK, this is pretty weird.  Nevertheless, the mutant has
	the ability to hide her extra body part (be it fur or arm) inside her
	own body; it just 'schloops' into a little compartment and is covered
	by a skin flap.  Useful.

Extra-Dimensional Acquisitive Storage (Physical/Social) [AL]
	A bizarre extra-dimensional space, the EDAS typically takes the shape
	of a pouch or pocket that only the mutant can access.  In truth, the
	pouch or pocket is merely a focus for the Power, and the mutant may
	use a different such holder each time he uses the Power.  This Power
	allows its user to reach into an extra-dimensional space and pull out
	a variety of useful items- which he did not necessarily deposit into
	the space.  Honey Lemon of the Big Hero Six has an Equipment version
	of this Power.  Higher Ranks in this Power allow larger pouches to
	be used (allowing larger items to be pulled out) and more exotic items
	to be retrieved.  A Charisma + EDAS roll is made for each extraction.
	The typical difficulty is six.  The items that the mutant pulls from
	the space DO come from somewhere, so they must exist beforehand.
	This Power NEVER recovers anything in view of anyone, or even within 
	one mile of the mutant if possible.  It also never recovers anything 
	that is currently in use by someone else, even remotely.
	
	Of course, the mutant may put an item into the pouch or pocket and
	pull it out again normally, without using this Power.
	
	¥ A pouch or pocket barely large enough to fit an adult human hand
	into can be used with this Power.  No weapons apart from knives can
	be pulled out.  Money can be retrieved, but only one bill or coin at
	a time- and the denomination or nationality of the currency cannot
	be predicted.  Small, useful items can be pulled.  Up to two items
	pulled from the pouch can be in the mutant's possession at a time.
	He must replace at least one if he wants to pull out a third.
	¥¥ A pouch up to six inches in diameter can be used with this Power.
	Any weapon of this size (including handguns- the model and type can
	not be predicted) can be pulled, as can any useful item of the
	appropriate size, assuming it exists.  Nothing too valuable, and
	certainly no unique item.  Up to three items can be pulled from the
	pouch before they have to be replaced.
	¥¥¥ A pouch of up to eight inches in diameter can be used with this
	Power.  Any weapon that would fit can be pulled, including more
	powerful weapons such as energy weapons (though this is more difficult
	and the type of weapon cannot be predicted).  The mutant can attempt
	to retrieve a specific item that he owns or is very familiar with-
	difficulty 10.  Up to four items can be pulled from the pouch before
	they have to be replaced.
	¥¥¥¥ A pouch of up to twelve inches in diameter can be used with
	this Power.  More valuable items can be retrieved, including some
	powerful weapons and exotic technology.  No magic of any kind can
	be retrieved.  Up to five items can be pulled from the pouch before
	one of them have to be replaced.
	¥¥¥¥¥ A pouch of up to twenty inches in diameter can be used with this
	Power.  Unique items (nothing magical) can be retrieved, though
	this is usually a difficulty 10 roll, sometimes requiring several
	successes.  Very powerful weapons and armours can be retrieved,
	and even ridiculously exotic and unusual items (like a space suit
	or technological gills) can be retrieved.  Up to six items can be
	in use at one time.

Extra Health Levels (Physical) [PN]
	The mutant has one extra Health level per level of this power.  They
	can be marked on the sheet as extras.  No mutant may have more Extra
	Health Levels than he has points of Stamina.  New Health levels cost
	ten points of experience each, and may be bought only by Physical
	characters or by characters who chose this as a power at character
	creation but are not Physical characters- in which case it costs fifteen
	points of experience.  Colossus, Storm, and Wolverine are all much
	tougher than normal humans- they have extra health levels.  These
	Health Levels may be assigned to any particular penalty category-
	so a character could have five Bruised levels, or two Incapacitated
	levels (don't laugh- it's handy!) or any combination desired.

Fault Detection and Exploitation (Physical/Social/Mental) [AN]
	Like Karnak of the Inhumans, a mutant with the Physical version of this
	Power has the ability to see the 'fault lines' or pressure points in
	matter and the body and exploit them to devastating effect.  Perfect
	eye- hand coordination is required for this Power to work, so only
	Brawling and Martial Arts attacks will enjoy the fruits of this special
	sight, not Melee or Firearms.  The mutant's attacks may inflict either
	bruising or lethal damage (his choice).  The Social version of this
	Power allows the mutant to see Power-related weaknesses such as Power
	Susceptibilities and other such Flaws, and is capable of creating these
	weaknesses in victims who have none.  The Mental version of this Power
	provides the mutant with information about any other Flaws the victim
	might have (Enemies, psychological Flaws, etc.) as well as
	derangements, and even the victim's greatest fears.

	Physical:
	¥¥¥ Add the successes your mutant gets on hit rolls to any Brawling,
	Do, or Martial Arts damage dice pool.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Axeman- if the character scores enough successes, he can actually
	smash wood and stone with ease, at minimal risk to his tissues.  ST
	determines the difficulty and number of successes required for a
	particular feat (unless the mutant has the stunt: It's All The Same).
	¥¥¥ Diagnosis- the mutant gets three automatic successes to any
	Perception + Medicine or Perception + Repair roll to see things like
	broken bones (or broken crankshafts).
	¥¥¥ The Edge- the mutant may choose to inflict edged (cutting) damage
	instead of blunt damage to living targets.
	¥¥¥ It's All The Same- all the mutant's difficulties to hit are six,
	regardless of how simple or ridiculously difficult the feat may seem.
	¥¥¥ Nerve Punch- the mutant may temporarily damage a victim's Strength,
	Stamina, or Dexterity instead of Health by attacking exposed nerves.
	This may be dodged, but not soaked.  Of course, there have to be nerves
	available to hit for this stunt to work.  Note that it usually takes at
	least two Nerve Punches to incapacitate a victim-- one or more to
	reduce an attribute to one point, and a final blow to reduce it to
	zero.  Damaged attributes heal as if the mutant had taken bashing
	damage.
	¥¥¥ Old Injury- with the expenditure of a point of Power Charge, the
	mutant may duplicate the damage of the worst single-hit hand-to-hand
	injury that his target has ever sustained (that is, after the damage
	was soaked).  This is unsoakable.
	¥¥¥ Shred Armour- the mutant may directly attack body armour to remove
	its efficacy.  For every point of damage it fails to soak, it loses
	one effective Rank.  This will heal (eventually) if the armour is not
	equipment.  The armour's auto-soaks and health levels are the only
	applicable defense on this roll (barring forcefields, etc.); the
	victim's Stamina is left out of it.  The victim himself will take no
	damage.  This works on Body Armour, Blood Armour, and Psychic Armour.

	Social:
	¥¥¥ Spot Power-related weaknesses and flaws in another being, including
	Flaws such as Power Weakness, Power Susceptibility, and special
	Power-specific Flaws such as Full Tilt.  Notice automatically if the
	victim draws power from a device such as Equipment or a Juju Focus. 
	The source of the victim's Power (genetic, induced, etc.) can be
	perceived with a Perception + Fault Detection roll (diff of the
	victim's Power Charge). The typical system is Perception + Fault
	Detection.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Charge-draining blow- by scoring a hit in combat (Dex + Brawl or
	Dex + Martial Arts), the mutant may drain off a point of Power Charge.
	¥¥¥ Create Flaw- the mutant may add an ST-determined Flaw to one of
	his victim's Powers (for instance, Power Weakness or even Dormant
	Power).  This requires a Charisma + Fault Detection roll; the difficulty
	is the victim's score in Power Potential, and the number of successes
	required is the Rank in the affected Power.  This lasts a scene.
	¥¥¥ Create Susceptibility- the mutant actually creates a susceptibility
	in the target (ST-determined) of 3-point value (susceptibility to a
	common Power).  This lasts a scene.  This requires a Charisma + Fault 
	Detection roll; the difficulty is the victim's score in Power Potential.  
	This lasts a scene.
	¥¥¥ Create Weakness- the mutant may make himself immune to one of the
	victim's Powers by adding a specific Power Weakness (such as inability
	to affect the colour yellow, if the mutant is wearing such).  This is a
	Charisma + Fault Detection roll; the difficulty is the victim's score
	in Power Potential, and the number of successes required is the Rank in
	the affected Power.  This lasts a scene.
	¥¥¥ Fuel Leak- by scoring a hit in combat (Dex + Brawl or Martial Arts),
	the mutant can cause his victim to spend a point of Gnosis, Blood Pool,
	Quintessence, etc.  The victim draws the benefits of the expenditure,
	if any.
	¥¥¥ Geyser- requires the Stunt: Fuel Leak.  After scoring a hit in
	combat (Dex + Brawl or Martial Arts) in the same round that the victim
	spends a point of an expendable Advantage (Willpower, Gnosis, Power
	Charge, etc.), the mutant may sit back and watch as the victim continues
	to leak a point of that trait every round, until it's dry.
	¥¥¥ Widen Crack- if a certain number is associated with a victim's Flaw
	(such as a dice penalty, or a difficulty modifier), the mutant can
	double it with a successful Charisma + Fault Detection roll (diff of
	the victim's Power Potential).
	
	Mental:
	¥¥¥ Detect all sorts of flaws-- or at least, any that the victim is
	aware of.  This includes insanity, social or financial flaws, even
	supernatural flaws.  Victims with Confidence Boost had better make a
	run for it.  The typical system is Perception + Fault Detection.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Assumption- requires the Stunt: System Breakdown.  The mutant may
	'bust into' a mental or supernatural link, or take it away from one
	party and assume it himself by using System Breakdown and succeeding
	on a contested Willpower check with each party concerned, if they are
	unwilling.  The mutant makes one such roll, and applies it against all
	parties.
	¥¥¥ Aura of Invincibility- the mutant appears invulnerable to a victim
	with Telepathy, Projective Empathy, etc., since she can see the places
	where the attacker is weakest.  All difficulties for such mind-invasive
	Powers are increased by 2.
	¥¥¥ Bend the Knee- all Expression, Performance, Leadership, and
	Subterfuge rolls are at -1 difficulty.
	¥¥¥ Blindside- the mutant can automatically penetrate Mind Armour,
	Psychic Armour, Psychic Fields, and Psychic Defenses if he has a Power
	appropriate to attack with; this requires an initial Perception + Fault
	Detection roll (diff 8)
	¥¥¥ Hole in the plot- the hero can see what his victim is planning with
	a Perception + Fault Detection roll (diff of the opponent's
	Intelligence + 2); the victim's player must announce his intentions
	before the mutant's player does for the rest of the scene.
	¥¥¥ Insinuation- the mutant knows just the right thing to say to punish
	the victim's will, draining off a point of Willpower with a successful
	Manipulation + Fault Detection roll (diff of the opponent's
	Intelligence + 2)
	¥¥¥ Interrogation- all Empathy rolls against a target are at -2
	difficulty; moreover, the mutant is immune to any form of lie
	detection, up to and including Cosmic Awareness.  Requires the Stunt:
	Aura of Invincibility.
	¥¥¥ System Breakdown- by expending a point of Power Charge and scoring
	a successful roll to hit (Dex + Brawl), the mutant can break a mental
	or supernatural link (such as a telepathic conversation, or even a
	Psychic Link).  The victim can resist if desired (Willpower roll, diff
	of the mutant's Manipulation + Leadership).
	¥¥¥ Terror- the mutant knows just what to say and how to look in order
	to terrify the victim; with a successful Manipulation + Fault Detection
	roll, the victim's Social difficulties are increased by 2, and he is at
	+1 diff to attack the mutant.

Flashback Summoning (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	A bizarre ability, to be sure, Flashback Summoning allows a mutant to
	exchange his 'current' self with a self from a possible future, a
	definite past, or an alternate timeline.  That is, if Wolverine had
	this Power, he could suddenly exchange himself for Weapon X (from the
	Age of Apocalypse) or for the Wolverine from next Christmas.  Rachel
	Summers invoked a version of this Power to send Kate Pryde to warn the
	X-Men about the Days of Future Past.  The alternate version
	automatically has this Power at the same Rank (if he didn't before, he
	receives it for the duration of the exchange).  The only rule is that a
	summoned duplicate can only summon the person who summoned him
	(bringing the original back).  Note that damage, Willpower, etc. does
	NOT cross over between duplicates; however, knowledge does not
	automatically do so, either. A duplicate can remain for as long as he
	desires; the original has no power to regulate his behavior, and it is
	possible that the duplicate will never allow him to return.  The system
	for this Power is Stamina + Flashback Summoning, and the difficulty
	varies with the 'distance' between the summoner and the summoned.
	
	Note that selves summoned from the past will be returned to alternate
	timelines.  Which is to say, you can't change the past with this
	Power.
	
	¥ The mutant can summon selves from as far in the past or future as
	ten minutes (diff 8).
	¥¥ The mutant can summon selves from as far in the past or future as
	one year (diff 8- Rank One effects at diff 7).
	¥¥¥ The mutant can summon selves from as far in the past or future
	as twenty years (diff 8- Rank One effects at diff 6, Rank Two at
	diff 6).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can summon selves from any time within his lifetime,
	or from an alternate time-line present (diff 9).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can summon past, present, or future selves from any 
	timeline or dimension (diff 9- Rank four effects at diff 8, Rank 3
	effects at diff 7, Rank 2 effects at diff 6, and Rank 1 effects at
	diff 5).

Flawless (Physical/Mental) [AN]
	Some mutants seem to be 'the best they are at what they do'- like
	Wolverine, Gambit, and Monet St. Croix (at least in their earlier
	incarnations), a mutant with the Flawless Power rarely fails.  For
	every rank in this Power, the mutant can ignore a single 'one'
	(treating it as a mere failure).  A total lack of successes still
	counts against the mutant, but he will rarely, if ever, botch.  This
	Flawlessness can either extend to Physical or Mental rolls (rolls
	involving either Physical Attributes or Mental attributes).

	¥ The mutant can ignore a single 'one' per roll
	¥¥ Two 'ones'
	¥¥¥ Three 'ones'
	¥¥¥¥ Four 'ones'
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five 'ones'

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Difficulty 'ten' rolls are reduced to diff 9.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Difficulty 'ten' and 'nine' rolls are reduced in difficulty by
	one.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant may ignore any 'ones', treating them as mere
	failures.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Difficulty 10, 9, and 8 rolls are reduced in difficulty by
	one.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The difficulty of all rolls which have a base difficulty of
	6 or higher is reduced by one.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Unbridled Arrogance- the mutant resists Occlusion and other
	confidence- sapping Powers (including certain uses of Projective
	Empathy) automatically if a Power would affect dice pools associated
	with her Flawlessness.
	¥¥ Concentration- the mutant may pick one specialty per Rank in
	commonly associated Abilities, rather than just a single specialty.
	A Mental character might be able to choose multiple specialties for
	Knowledges, while a Physical character could do so for such Abilities
	as Brawl and Drive.
	¥¥ Inspiration- all allies regain a point of Willpower whenever they
	witness the mutant arriving to help them out with the thing he does
	best.
	¥¥¥ Reputation- the mutant may add her Rank in Fame, whenever it
	applies, to her Intimidation dice pools.
	¥¥¥ Well Rounded- the mutant may purchase the other variation with
	experience points.
	¥¥¥¥ Better Than You- whenever the mutant engages in a contested
	Ability check using a dice pool in which he is Flawless, he is
	considered to win any ties by one success.
	¥¥¥¥¥ More than Mortal- Requires the Stunt: Better Than You.  In
	contests against normal humans, the mutant is automatically considered
	to win any contested rolls for applicable pools by five successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Perfection*- the mutant may purchase 'perfection' in a
	particular Talent, Skill, or Knowledge (apart from Brawl, Dodge,
	Firearms, Martial Arts, Melee, Missiles, or Heavy Weapons), at least
	when applied by the Attribute category in which he is flawless.
	Perfection allows the mutant to count one or more successes (so long
	as he scores at least one success) as five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Best There Is At What He Does- In contests against opponents
	whose primary Power Category is not the same as the mutant's (either
	Physical or Mental, in this case), and in which this Power is in the
	mutant's primary Power Category, he is considered to automatically win
	any contested roll by the margin by which his dice pool is larger than
	his opponent's.  Thus, Wolverine (Dex + Brawl dice pool of 12) tears
	Cyclops (Dex + Dodge dice pool of 8) a new nostril by a margin of four
	successes without even rolling the dice.  Automatic successes to which
	either party is entitled not only count as extra dice against this
	total, but also modify the final margin-- effectively being counted
	twice.  Note that Logan couldn't use this stunt on Wolfsbane, since
	she is a Physical character (whereas poor Cyke is Social).  Monet, on
	the other hand, could whup Wolverine's butt at chess (Intelligence +
	Enigmas pool of 10 versus Logan's equivalent pool of 6, giving her four
	successes), but she'd have no such advantage against him in initiative
	(Logan's got 13 dice for Wits + Alertness, whereas Monet has a mere
	eight) even though it's a Mental action.

Flesh Rot (Physical) [AL]
	This disgusting Power allows a mutant to putrefy organic matter (here
	not carbon-based material as such, but rather living or formerly
	living tissue) at a touch.  This can cause damage, of course, and
	death.  It would be difficult to imagine a mutant with this Power who
	did not evoke fear from humans and his fellow mutants.  In order to
	trigger it, the mutant must touch his victims (Dex + Brawl or as
	appropriate) and then trigger his Power (Stamina + Flesh Rot,
	difficulty of the opponent's Stamina + 3, max of 10).  If he does not
	maintain contact between one round and the next (through the use of
	subterfuge, grappling, or another low-concentration Power such as
	Matter Bonding) then he must split his dice pool.

	¥ At a touch, the mutant can cause one Health Level of aggravated
	damage (plus the number of successes he rolled to trigger the Power)
	against organic material, difficulty eight to soak.  Note that
	processed organic material (such as paper or biological body armour)
	is treated as having a Stamina two higher than normal for the purposes
	of determining this Power's difficulty.
	¥¥ Two plus Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥¥ Three plus Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥ Four plus Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five plus Health Levels

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Aging Factor- the mutant can choose to expend a point of Power
	Charge and age a living thing instead (typically by the mutant's
	Rank in years per success).  Under normal circumstances, this is
	irreversible.

Flight (Physical/Mental) [AN]
	A popular ability, the Power of Flight should not be confused with
	the Wings power that Archangel is heir to.  Rather, consider Rogue
	or the Vision.  Flight, whether it is powered by special internal
	organs at work or by a mental process, does not necessarily derive
	itself from an external physical cause.  The mutant can always
	breathe normally at her maximum flight speed.  The character must
	purchase the Skill: Flight to use this Power properly.  To fly,
	a Dexterity + Flight roll (not the Power, but the Skill of the
	same name) is not normally required, except under unusual conditions.
	
	¥ Flight speed of 50 km/h is possible
	¥¥ Flight speed of 100 km/h
	¥¥¥ Flight speed of 150 km/h
	¥¥¥¥ Flight speed of 200 km/h
	¥¥¥¥¥ Flight speed of 500 km/h
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mach one
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Mach two
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Mach three
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Mach five
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Sub-light speed
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Rarefied Air- the mutant has the ability to breathe in environments
	which have less air than normal- on mountaintops and the like.
	¥ Hover- the mutant can hover in place
	¥ Water Jetting- the mutant can 'fly' through water at one fifth her
	normal flight speed.
	¥¥ Vertigo protection- the mutant has an innate sense of up-and-down,
	has a -1 difficulty to balance checks, and does not suffer unduly from
	vertigo attacks (roll Stamina + Flight to resist).

Force Absorption and Conversion (Physical) [AN]
	This power, possessed by Sebastian Shaw of the Hellfire Club and by
	Strong Guy of X-Factor, serves to make the mutant extremely difficult
	to kill.  Blunt force trauma (a normal hit that doesn't spill guts)
	is automatically absorbed and converted into a form that the mutant
	can use.  This can be quite distressing to the mutant's opponents.
	Many variations on this power exist.  The maximum amount of energy
	absorbed, if it is stored in the mutant's body in some form, is
	equal to the Power Rank.  Once the maximum amount of damage energy
	is stored in the mutant's body, his ability to absorb further damage
	declines.  He can shed this energy at any time, however.  Note that
	Sebastian Shaw has Force Absorption/Conversion (Strength) AND Force
	Absorption/Conversion (Stamina)!  No roll is required.

	¥ One point of damage is automatically absorbed and converted.
	¥¥ Two points
	¥¥¥ Three points
	¥¥¥¥ Four points
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen points

	Common Variations:
	* Energy Conversion- if the mutant has an energy emission power, he can
	add an automatic damage success for every point absorbed.  A normal
	Dexterity + Directed blast is required to hit.
	* Health Conversion- the mutant heals a Health Level of normal damage
	for every point absorbed, or a Level of aggravated damage for every
	two points.  The damage eligible for healing includes 'overlap damage' 
	that he does not soak when this Power is activated.
	* Invulnerability- the mutant gets temporary Invulnerability, at a
	Rank equivalent to his Rank in this Power.  This resistance to damage
	lasts one round per Health Level absorbed and converted.  Since he is
	Invulnerable, the mutant cannot absorb further energy until the initial
	effect wears off.
	* Stamina Conversion- like Strength conversion.
	* Strength Conversion- the mutant gets a temporary point of Strength
	for every Health level of damage he absorbs.  His maximum Strength
	level is 5 + his Power Rank in this Power.  This Strength lasts one
	scene.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Downshift- the mutant can use an action to shed his stored energy
	instead of Dodging an attack.  This allows him (obviously) to take
	more damaging blows.
	¥¥¥ Overflow- the mutant, if he successfully soaks the extra damage
	associated with a blunt-force attack, can use that extra energy in
	that round if he has not yet gone- so long as that extra energy does
	not exceed his Power Rank.  e.g. Siege, who is at full Strength (9),
	is punched by Creed for another 4 Health Levels of damage.  If Siege
	soaks all of this damage, he has one round at Strength 13- that round.
	He can then counterattack Creed at this Strength.  If Creed had struck
	him for 5 damage (even if he soaked it all), or if he hadn't soaked
	the full 4, Siege could not use this Stunt.  If Siege had already gone
	that round, this temporary Strength boost would be wasted.

Force Field (Social) [AL]
	A character with a Force Field (like Skids) has a potent protection
	from both physical and energy-based attacks.  Normally, the mutant can
	turn the field on and off at will, and its strength is measured in
	dice (which can be used as an expression of the field's ability to
	absorb punishment or as a measure of the field's physical Strength).
	When the field is under attack, it gets a soak roll.  If the field is
	defeated (takes at least one die of damage) that damage passes through
	the field to the character, who must then make his own soak roll.
	If the mutant makes a successful Willpower check, the field is not
	disrupted by the breech and re-seals itself.  If the damage proves to
	be excessive (an amount of damage passes through the field equal to
	or greater than the dice pool of the field itself), the mutant must
	make a Willpower check (diff 6) to remain conscious.  To erect a
	successful field requires a Stamina + Forcefield roll (diff 6).
	
	¥ Forcefields constructed by the mutant have an effective Strength and 
	Stamina of 2, and can take 2 Health Levels of damage before losing
	integrity.  All excess (unsoaked) damage passes through the field to 
	the target.
	¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 3, and can 
	take 3 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 4, and can 
	take 4 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 5, and can 
	take 5 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength and Stamina of 6, and can 
	take 6 Health Levels of damage before losing integrity.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Forcefields have one effective Strength, Stamina, and Health
	rating of 8, plus one automatic soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Constructs have an effective Strength, Stamina, and Health
	rating of 10.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 12, and
	two automatic soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 14.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Constructs have Strength, Stamina, and Health of 16, and
	three automatic soak.
	
	Forcefields that have taken some punishment can be revitalized
	(healed) with concentration.  A Stamina + Forcefield roll (diff 6)
	will 'heal' one Health Level of damage per success, so long as
	the field still has at least one Health Level left or if the
	character has made a successful Willpower check (as above).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Shape field- rather than be surrounded in a globe of field energy,
	the mutant can make the field any shape she wants, up to 4 feet in
	radius or smaller.
	¥¥ Expand field- the mutant may expand her field by 2 feet in radius
	at the cost of one point each of Strength and Stamina, to a minimum
	of one each for a really big field.
	¥¥¥ Skate- the mutant can cause the field energy to 'coruscate'- that
	is, move in a specific pattern- and thus move her along the ground at
	a speed of 5 mph/Rank.  The mutant is not touching the ground with any
	part of her body.

Free Action (Physical) [PN]
	You are possessed of graceful and effortless movement, coming from
	perfect knowledge of your body and its capabilities.  Beyond a certain
	entrancing quality to your normal range of movement, this allows
	unrestricted action in all kinds of terrain.  All difficulties for
	Athletics are reduced, and most complications affecting difficulty for
	such dice pools as Dodge, Blindfighting, Swimming, Acrobatics,
	Climbing, and other movement-associated abilities are ignored.  That
	is, it is no more difficult for a mutant with Free Action to dodge
	while swimming or hanging on the side of a cliff than it is on the
	ground.  You must be immobilized before such conditions will affect
	the difficulties on such rolls.  No roll is required to use this
	Power.
	
	¥ Athletics difficulties are reduced by one.
	¥¥ Athletics difficulties are reduced by two; movement speed over
	rough terrain is doubled.
	¥¥¥ Athletics difficulties are reduced by three; movement speed when
	climbing or swimming is doubled.
	¥¥¥¥ Athletics difficulties are reduced by four; the mutant may elect
	to automatically succeed on any non-combat related movement roll with
	an unadjusted difficulty of six or less.  He is considered to have
	three successes in this case, and may elect instead to roll.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Athletics difficulties are reduced by five.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Evaluation- the mutant can immediately see whether or not an
	opening is too narrow to fit through or if a space is too small to
	hold an object or any combination of objects.
	¥ Stroll In The Park- with her easy grace and economy of movement,
	the mutant does not waste extraneous energy when getting from A to B.
	Whether she's running a marathon, climbing a cliff face, or swimming
	across a lake, she doubles her effective Stamina for the purposes of
	checking for the effects of exertion.
	¥¥ Natural extension- The mutant need not be 'going natural' to
	use the movement advantages of this Power; any machine that is 
	powered and/or controlled directly by the mutant (such as a bicycle,
	hang glider	or kayak, but not a motorcycle, balloon, or sailboat)
	may also be used in this way, at least as regards traversing
	difficult obstacles.
	¥¥ Performance- any skill such as figure skating or dancing, which
	is constituted by graceful movement, is absolutely entrancing when
	performed by the mutant.  The equivalent of a Projective Empathy ¥¥
	effect settles over everyone who sees the character at work.  The
	mutant may choose different dances or performances to encourage a 
	particular emotional response, but each crowd member will have her own
	reaction (be it lust, rapture, sorrow, etc.)
	¥¥¥ Cascade- when splitting dice pools for Athletics, Dodge, Swimming,
	Blindfighting,  Acrobatics, or Climbing, the other (non-movement)
	ability's dice pool is halved, but the movement-related ability's pool
	remains at full strength.  Note that the mutant cannot use this to
	make more than two movement-related actions in one round, unless he
	has a Power such as Hyper-Speed or Rage.

Friction Control* (Social) [AH]
	This Power alters the strength of the immediate powers of attraction
	and repulsion between molecules in different objects.  Basically, this
	means that passing matter 'pulls at' an object that has had its
	susceptibility to friction increased, and, again, it is less likely to
	'pull at' an object which is less subject to friction.  A frictionless
	object does not interact with other matter at all, except as regards
	forces like gravity or magnetism.  This Power must be bought at least
	at Rank two.  The roll required is usually an Intelligence + Friction
	roll (diff 4 + the Rank of the desired effect).
	
	Increase effects
	¥¥ Top speed for running, swimming, etc. is halved.  Swimming in normal
	water is like pushing through thick soup.  One less die of damage to
	all melee and brawling attacks made by an affected character.  Dodge,
	Brawl, Missiles, and Melee difficulties are increased by one.
	¥¥¥ Objects with increased friction 'cling' to other objects as if
	they had been run through an electric dryer without a Bounce sheet.
	A character's top speed is quartered, and can only engage in strenuous
	activity for a number of rounds equal to his Stamina score before
	starting to tire (-1 die penalty to all actions, cumulative, calculated
	every few rounds (equal to Stamina) afterward).  Dodge, Brawl, Missiles,
	and Melee rolls are diff + 2.
	¥¥¥¥ Moving through air is like moving through a swimming pool.  Missile
	attacks using objects under this aegis are impossible.  Moving through
	water is like moving through a solid field of Nerf foam.  Dodge, Brawl,
	and Melee rolls are diff + 3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Moving through air will actually start to cause friction burns and
	may set the character alight if violent motions are entertained.  The
	character must soak one Health Level of damage (diff 7) in any round in
	which he makes a movement that is not slow and deliberate.  It is
	difficult to breathe at this level- the mutant will lose consciousness
	if he engages in strenuous activity for more than (Stamina) rounds.
	Dodge, Brawl, and Melee rolls are diff + 4.
	
	Decrease effects
	¥¥ Any attack with a melee weapon that has been affected (or if the
	person swinging it has been affected) requires a Dexterity check to
	keep from being disarmed by the movement.  Surfaces are about as
	slippery as lightly waxed linoleum.
	¥¥¥ Surfaces are as slippery as ice.  Movement faster than a slow,
	deliberate walk requires a Dexterity check (diff 7) to avoid slipping
	or losing the object.
	¥¥¥¥ Surfaces are as slippery as oiled black ice.  Movement of any
	kind requires a Dexterity check (diff 8) to avoid slipping or losing
	the object.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Perfect lack of friction.  A mutant who has become perfectly
	frictionless cannot coordinate his movements.  Keeping a hold of anything 
	or accurate horizontal movement is quite impossible if a frictionless 
	object or surface is involved.  Happy landings!

Gateway* (Social) [AL]
	The mutant Gateway gave his name to this Power, but it is also possessed
	by mutants such as Blink, Magik, Fitzroy, and Siege.  A variation of 
	teleportation, Gateway creates a portal between one place and another, 
	which anyone can step through.  These portals are not restricted merely 
	to space, but can also traverse time and dimension.  At character creation, 
	the player must decide whether these portals are one-way (like Fitzroy's
	were, at least in practice) or two-way.  The standard roll for this Power
	is the mutant's current temporary Willpower.  The difficulty is Rank-
	oriented; creation of Gateways that require all of the mutant's power to
	open (i.e.- match his current Rank in the Power) are difficulty 7.  Any
	lesser portal is one less point of difficulty per Rank of distance between
	its effects and the mutant's Rank in the Power.  For example, Billy the
	Door is trying to escape from the Puppet Master, and creates a Gateway
	that will take him a mile way.  Since Billy has Gateway at Rank three,
	and since a Gateway that can traverse a mile requires only Rank one,
	the difficulty for this feat is 5.
	
	Special Flaw: No tiller- when using a gateway to travel through time, the
	mutant can only specify the Rank at which the Power will operate, not
	the direction or actual period.  Thus, a mutant with Rank 4 Gateway can
	specify that he would like to travel an hour or less (as Rank 4) or
	one minute or less (as Rank 3), but can not predict whether she will be
	visiting the past or the future, nor what the exact amount of time that 
	she will travel will be.  This is a 2 point Flaw.
	
	¥ Gateways can link locations up to five miles apart.
	¥¥ Gateways can link locations up to one hundred miles apart.
	¥¥¥ The portals can be anywhere on Earth, or can link times of up to
	one minute apart.
	¥¥¥¥ The portals can be anywhere in the universe, and can link times of
	hour's difference.  Dimensional travel between alternate timelines
	(similar worlds) and subplanes (like Limbo) is possible.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The portals can be anywhere in the universe, and can link any
	times of up to one day's difference.  Dimensional travel between
	any two worlds, no matter how different, is possible.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ One or Two Way- the mutant may choose, each time she opens a portal,
	whether it will be permeable one-way or two-ways.
	¥¥¥ Orientation- the portal may be canted (that is, it need not be
	aligned vertically) at any angle the mutant desires.
	¥¥¥ Semi-Permeable [AH]- the mutant may choose to disallow certain
	persons, objects, or substances from passing through a gateway with
	concentration.
	¥¥¥¥ Gravitic pull - the portal exerts a gravitic pull that will suck
	things through it.  Strength of pull: 2 successes/rank.

Geomancy (Social) [AL]
	As old philosophers have observed, there is breath, or energy, in
	everything.  Your mutant is connected to this breath and can push it
	in certain ways.  While this Power does not afford the sort of fine
	control offered by related Powers, its breadth and strength more than
	make up the difference.  Typically, the system is Perception + 
	Geomancy, and the area of effect is a cylinder 10 feet in diameter.
	
	Special Flaw: Heart of the Earth (4 pts.)- Your geomancy is out of
	control-- literally.  Geomantic effects occur spontaneously in your
	presence, and the type that occurs is related to your emotional state.
	They are not usually damaging effects.  When you are happy, the sun
	may burn through the clouds and flowers may blossom at your feet.
	Soft rain follows bitterness, and earthquakes may occur when you are
	angry.  Unfortunately, your friends may not be immune to the more
	potent effects.  No roll is required, except under special circumstances 
	(ST's discretion)-- the damage pool is assumed to be twice the mutant's
	Rank in Geomancy.
	
	¥ Typical geomantic effects (not necessarily earth-related) include the
	formation of geysers, bubbling up of swamps or poisonous gases,
	formation of ice crystals or snow, or lashing rainfall.  Localized
	earthquakes and pitfalls are not unusual.  Plants may grow wildly and
	cut enemies.  Wood may explode into splinters.  Sudden winds are also
	possible.  In any case, the damage pool is the mutant's Rank in
	Geomancy plus her successes on a Perception + Geomancy roll (diff. 8).  
	The range of the effect is ten feet.
	¥¥ The range is forty feet, and the difficulty is 7.
	¥¥¥ The range is 100 feet, and the difficulty is 7.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is one mile, and the difficulty is 6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range is ten miles, and the difficulty is 6.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The range is 100 miles, and the difficulty is 6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can cause an eruption anywhere on Earth.  The 
	difficulty for this is 8.  If she uses it within 100 miles or less,
	the difficulty is only 5.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Regional- a geomantic effect that is appropriate to the region (ice
	explosions in the Antarctic, sandstorms in the Sahara, geysers in
	Yellowstone), enjoys a difficulty reduction of one.
	¥¥ Aggravated- the mutant can choose to make the damage from a Geomancy
	attack aggravated at the cost of two successes.  These are no longer used
	to calculate damage pool.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Broad horizons- the area of effect can be increased at the cost
	of one success per Rank (to increase the area affected from ten feet to
	one mile-- Rank one range to Rank four range-- would cost three
	successes).  Note that the area of effect can not be larger than the
	range.
	
Glamour (Social) [AL]
	More than just the ability to create illusions, glamour is an illusion made
	real by altering the fabric of reality temporarily and replacing one object
	with a created or imagined one.  As long as the character spends Willpower
	to maintain the illusion, the illusion will exist one scene per Willpower
	point spent.  The character does not even have to be near the changed
	object, he merely spends the points to maintain the change.  Glamoured items
	require a physical object from the mortal world that are transformed (eg.
	leaves into coins, a pumpkin into a carriage, etc.).  Glamour leaves the
	object after points are no longer pumped into it or if it is dispelled.
	Glamour is dispelled through various means.
	
	The most common type of glamour is Faery Glamour, it may be dispelled by the
	following: object is sprinkled with salt or holy water, a bell chime,
	overwhelmed by disbelief (willpower roll), hearing a hymn or prayer, cold
	iron, holy objects touching them (bible, cross), Rowan wood/berries, red
	ribbons (tied), pentagrams, daisy chains, inverted clothing.
	
	Glamour affects all five senses and can affect the physical world.  Even
	after the illusion vanishes any effect it may have had upon the world
	remains (including physical evidence such as footprints, wounds, eaten food,
	etc.).
	
	¥ Objects created are brittle and shatter after 2 health levels of damage
	(unless it is normally breakable, than any damage will shatter it such as
	glass, paper, etc.).  The maximum damage the "thing" can do is 2 points.
	Size is limited to 1 cubic foot in volume.
	¥¥ Objects may have up to 4 health levels, do up to 4 damage points and
	take up to 8 cubic feet in volume.
	¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 6 health levels, do up to 6 damage points and
	take up to 27 cubic feet in volume.
	¥¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 8 health levels, do up to 8 damage points and
	take up to 64 cubic feet in volume.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 10 health levels, do up to 10 damage points
	and take up to 125 cubic feet in volume.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Objects may have up to 12 health levels, do up to 12 damage points
	and take up to 216 cubic feet in volume.  The mutant may learn one Realm
	and one Art up to level two.  These must be taught to him by a Faery.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Objects may have up to 14 health levels, do up to 14 damage points
	and take up to 343 cubic feet in volume.  The mutant may learn a second
	Art.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 16 health levels, do up to 16 damage and
	take up to 512 cubic feet.  The mutant may learn a second Realm.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 18 health levels, do up to 18 damage and
	take up to 729 cubic feet.  The mutant may increase his Arts to level 3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Objects may have up to 20 health levels, do up to 20 damage
	and take up to 1000 cubic feet.  The mutant may learn a third Art and
	Realm.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Weapon- character must state what exactly the weapon is and what it looks
	like.  Damage inflicted is as per weapon.  Fantasy weapons, such as a water
	pistol that turns into a laser gun, may do up to their maximum damage of the
	power level.  The player must declare the damage and then it will remain
	that for as long as it is changed.

Gnosis (Social/Mental) [AL]
	This ability is much like the power of the Werewolf- it is a connection
	to the spirit world that can be harnessed to perform various tasks,
	including spiritual communication, gaining special insights, and even
	Umbral Travel.  The mutant may purchase the Knowledges: Cosmology and
	Spirit Lore if she has this Power.  This Power cannot be improved, and
	is worth 3 power ranks to purchase.  The mutant may also purchase the
	Talent: Primal Urge and the Talent: Awareness with experience.
	Temporary Gnosis can be recharged through meditation (Wits +
	Meditation, diff 8).  Shaman of Alpha Flight has Gnosis.  No roll is
	normally required (though occasionally a straight Gnosis roll (the
	Trait, not the Power) is called for).  Points of Gnosis are usually
	spent to activate the various effects.
	
	¥¥¥ The character adds the Gnosis ability to her character sheet.  This
	is a continuum of Permanent and Temporary Gnosis points, in the vein of
	Willpower, with a maximum score of 10 in each.  The character starts
	with one point of Gnosis.  More points may be bought with freebie
	points (3 per dot) or experience (3 x current rating).  The character
	now has the potential to learn Spirit Speech, to learn how to step
	sideways into the Umbra, and perhaps learn a few things from spirits.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Aura Sight- the mutant can read auras to get insights about the
	nature of the person she is reading.  This takes one Gnosis point.
	Information about emotional states, health, etc. can be gleaned
	with enough successes.
	¥¥¥ Detect Spirits- the mutant can vaguely sense the presence of
	spirits with the expenditure of a point of Gnosis and a successful
	Perception + Awareness roll.
	¥¥¥ Gift- the mutant can learn Werewolf Gifts by paying 7 points of
	Experience per level of the gift.  Each Gift is a separate Power Stunt.
	The mutant must still find someone to teach it to her...  Only gifts of
	the third level or less can be learned.  Note that Gifts that require
	the expenditure of Rage (or rely in some way on a Rage score) will not
	work unless the mutant has that Power.  Note also that shapeshifting
	Gifts will not work either, unless the mutant has a Power such as
	Physical Transformation, Shapeshifting, Physical Imitation, or True
	Mimicry.
	¥¥¥ Spirit Sight- requires Aura Sight.  The mutant can see across the
	Gauntlet on a successful Perception + Primal Urge roll and the
	expenditure of a point of Gnosis.  This also allows mutants to detect
	the dead.
	¥¥¥ Spirit Speech- requires that the mutant be in the Umbra, or use
	Spirit Sight.  She can communicate with spirits and understand what
	they are saying to her.  Whether or not they get along...
	¥¥¥ Step Sideways- requires the Power: Umbral Travel.  The mutant does
	not need weak places in the Gauntlet to get into the Umbra, but can
	use reflective surfaces and a point of Gnosis to step sideways like
	a Werewolf would do.
	¥¥¥ Umbral Travel- the mutant may buy the Power: Umbral Travel with
	experience points, even if she did not start with this Power, once
	this Stunt is bought.

Gravity Manipulation* (Social) [AL]
	Graviton and Freefall of Gen-13 have this Power.  Fortunately for heroes
	everywhere, Graviton is a total dunce.  This is not the ability to change
	the mass of another character or the earth itself, but rather the mutant
	can create a localized gravitic field in which the weights of objects are
	radically altered.  This power can immobilize characters, allow flight,
	or even send folks spinning off into outer space in extreme circumstances.
	This is usually a Wits + Gravity roll (diff 7).
	
	¥ Double or halve the target's weight.  A minimum Strength of 3 is needed
	to move at this level of increase; a five for a Crinos-form Garou.
	Extremely light characters can run 50% faster than normal, and can perform
	Hyper Leaps at Rank one.
	¥¥ Quadruple or quarter the target's weight.  A minimum Strength of 5 is
	required for a normal human to move at this increase level; a seven for
	Crinos Garou.  Rank ¥¥¥ Hyper-Leaps are possible and double-speed running
	for a lightened character.
	¥¥¥ Increase or decrease the target's weight by eight times.  A minimum
	Strength of 9 is required for a normal human to move at this level of
	increase; an 11 for a Crinos Garou or being of equivalent size and
	original weight.  A Hyper-Leap of Rank five is possible and triple-speed
	running can be performed for lightened characters.
	¥¥¥¥ Increase the target's weight sixteen times, or reduce the target's
	weight to zero.  No movement is possible at this level of increase.  The
	character will take 2 Health Levels of crushing damage per round.  The
	slightest movement on the part of a lightened character may cause her to
	fly giddily out of control- at least until she is out of sight of the
	Gravity Manipulator (when she regains her original weight).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Increase the target's weight thirty-two times, or actually repel
	the target (anti-gravity!)  No movement is possible if increased.  The
	character's bones may break; five Health Levels of crushing damage must
	be soaked per round.  Repelled characters can be thrown at speeds of up
	to fifty mph; they are thrown with an equivalent Strength of (Rank + 2)
	or seven points.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Anti-gravity- the mutant has developed the ability to manipulate
	anti-gravity- this allows her to smash people into objects and throw
	things with a Strength of (Rank + 2).  This Stunt comes automatically
	at Rank Five.  Also allows flight at speeds of up to 10 mph/rank.
	¥¥¥¥ Thin Layers- by overlaying fields of differing gravitic force,
	the mutant can subtract his successes on an Intelligence + Gravity
	Manipulation roll from incoming physical attacks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Dogpile!- the target of the mutant's Power actually begins to
	attract small objects to it- like knives, water, etc.

Hard Air Manipulation (Social) [AL]
	Last seen being wielded by Windshear of Alpha Flight (blast from the
	past!) this is the ability to create and manipulate 'hard air'- gas
	that has some of the properties of solids- in fact, this air can take
	on as many of the properties of solids as the mutant desires. For
	example, the air can take on the hardness of a solid, the increased
	friction level, the rigidity, etc.  It does not have to take on all of
	these properties- for instance, it can be hard without being rigid. 
	The more rarefied the gas, the more difficult it will be for the
	mutant to get it to behave.  The mutant can also cause the air to move
	(creating winds) and cause hard air to change its shape. Note that
	this Power does not generally distinguish between different sorts of
	gases.  Most of the time, a Manipulation + Hard Air Manipulation roll
	will be called for.  The standard difficulty is 6.  Air that is in a
	container, out of sight (such as a human body) is diff 10 to
	manipulate.  This Power requires concentration.  The range of this
	Power is roughly 5 feet per Rank.

	¥ Air constructs can inflict two Health Levels of damage, have an
	effective Strength and Stamina of 2, and can take 2 Health Levels of
	damage before being discorporated.  If being used as a forcefield, all
	excess (unsoaked) damage passes through the hard air to the target.
	¥¥ Constructs can inflict three Health Levels of damage, have an
	effective Strength and Stamina of 3, and can take 2 Health Levels of
	damage before being discorporated.
	¥¥¥ Constructs can inflict four Health Levels of damage, have an
	effective Strength and Stamina of 4, and can take 3 Health Levels of
	damage before being discorporated.
	¥¥¥¥ Constructs can inflict five Health Levels of damage, have an
	effective Strength and Stamina of 4, and can take 3 Health Levels of
	damage before being discorporated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Constructs can inflict six Health Levels of damage, have an
	effective Strength and Stamina of 4, and can take 4 Health Levels of
	damage before being discorporated.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Sound barrier- the constructs may be made impervious to sound at
	the mutant's option.
	¥¥ Chill- it is possible to restrict the movement of the molecules in
	the construct, dropping the temperature by 5 degrees Celsius per
	success.
	¥¥¥ Cloudy- the mutant may muddy the transparency of a construct by
	manipulating the water vapour in it.  Requires the Stunt: Discriminate.
	¥¥¥ Discriminate- the mutant can distinguish between different gases
	in the air, and affect only those gases desired.  Naturally, the
	difficulty for manipulating specific gases (apart from nitrogen)
	increases because of their rarefication.
	¥¥¥¥ Compression- by layering constructs in a gradient of rigidity,
	they can be allowed to deform under pressure-- greatly increasing
	their effective Strength and Stamina.  This is a difficulty 8 roll,
	and every success increases the Strength and Stamina of the construct
	by one.  Blunt force attacks versus the construct are at +2 diff on
	damage tests.

Healing Factor (Physical) [AN]
	This ability can be an extremely powerful one- although it is not a
	directly damaging power, it can allow a mutant to stay in the fight
	for the long haul.  Variations of this power can even allow
	regeneration of limbs, etc.  Wolverine, Sabretooth, Deadpool... all
	have Healing Factors.  Usually, no roll is required apart from the
	occasional Stamina check.
	
	¥ The character can heal one non-aggravated Health Level/round, with
	concentration.
	¥¥ The character can heal one non-aggravated Health level per round
	involuntarily, so long as he is conscious.
	¥¥¥ The character recovers one Health level of non-aggravated damage
	per round involuntarily, or either one level of aggravated damage
	or three levels of normal damage per round with concentration.  If
	the character is unconscious, only one Health level per hour is
	healed (non-aggravated).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant recovers Health as per level three, except that the
	unconscious rate of healing is as the normal involuntary rate,
	and aggravated damage is healed at the rate of one level per day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant recovers his Stamina in Health levels with concentration
	if damage is non-aggravated, or up to three levels of aggravated
	damage per round.  He rolls his Stamina (diff 6) to determine the
	number of Health levels healed involuntarily per round (minimum of
	one).  He will heal one Health level of aggravated damage per round
	involuntarily.  Mutant will recover from death unless precautions are
	taken.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mutant recovers his Stamina in Health levels per round,
	voluntarily or involuntarily, if the damage is not aggravated, or
	up to three levels of aggravated damage the same way.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant does not require his brain and heart to recover
	from death, merely requiring a substantial (20%) portion of his body
	to do so.  This portion cannot have been denatured by aggravated
	damage (heat, acid, etc.)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ So long as the mutant has at least 5% of his body, he can
	recover from death.  This portion need not be all of one piece, so
	long as it is contiguous, and it can be any formerly living part,
	including blood or other body parts that contain the full genetic
	information.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ So long as the mutant has at least one undamaged cell,
	he can recover from death.  The cell needs to contain all of the
	mutant's genetic information, so sperm or ova aren't going to get
	the job done.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ So long as a single, undamaged strand of DNA exists,
	the mutant can recover from death.  This may take a while; the
	strand will act as a virus, roaming about until it finds some
	appropriate living matter.  Once it finds that, the DNA will
	rebuild the mutant (to the detriment of the host).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Aging Factor- the mutant ages only very slowly, and will live a very
	long time unless killed.  Ignore any Attribute penalties for old
	age.  No roll is required.
	¥ Fast metabolism- the mutant can metabolize alcohol or digest food
	very quickly.  No roll is required.
	¥ Pain Tolerance- the mutant can roll his Willpower (diff 7)- on three
	successes, he ignores all dice penalties for one scene.  This is
	an action.
	¥¥ Willed Regeneration- the mutant can regenerate lost limbs with
	concentration- the speed of this recovery depends on the size of
	the limb.  This requires a Stamina check (diff 8).
	¥¥ Immunity to diseases- except particularly nasty ones like the
	Legacy virus.
	¥¥ Resistance to poison- poisons are two points less difficult to
	soak.
	¥¥¥ Immunity to death factors, health vampirism, etc.
	¥¥¥ Transfusion healing- this powerful Stunt allows a mutant to heal
	others with his blood.  This requires a full transfusion (which
	inflicts two health levels of normal damage on the mutant).  At
	the end of the process, the recipient acts as though he has the
	mutant's involuntary healing abilities for one round per success
	on a Stamina roll (the recipient's Stamina).
	¥¥¥ Willed Growth- this bizarre ability requires the Willed Regeneration
	Power Stunt.  The mutant can grow his fingernails into claw-like
	weapons, or his hair into absurd lengths, or make thicker skin.  This
	can make for a quick disguise (grow a beard!).  A Stamina check (diff
	8) is required.
	¥¥¥¥ Death recovery- the mutant can sustain fatal wounds and come back
	from the dead if the brain or heart are not removed from the
	body.  This ability comes with level 5 Healing Factor automatically.
	A Stamina check (diff 9) is required to do this.
	¥¥¥¥ Physical Adaption- the mutant may buy the physical adaption
	power with experience points, even if he did not originally have
	this power.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Blood Disease- this disgusting ability allows a mutant with
	a powerful healing factor to "infect" another human with his blood.
	This will have the effect of slowly killing the victim as the mutant's
	blood actually "attacks" the victim's body as it regenerates, causing
	the body to suffer a toxic reaction.  The victim must soak two Health
	Levels of damage per day (diff 9) which thereafter cannot be healed
	naturally until the mutant's blood is purged.  No roll is required.
	Note that this stunt is incompatible with Transfusion healing, above,
	and will replace it.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Duplication- this bizarre use of a high-level healing factor
	allows the mutant to make duplicates of himself by severing some
	substantial portion of his body and feeding it with his blood.
	This requires the Willed Regeneration Power Stunt and a Willpower
	check (diff 8).  At least five Health Levels of damage must be
	sustained.

Healing [Others] (Social) [AL]
	This potent ability allows the mutant to greatly accelerate the rate of
	healing in other people (and, to a limited extent, himself) and purge
	the body of various diseases and ailments.  In some extreme cases,
	cellular regeneration and regrowth are possible- lost limbs might be
	rejoined to the body, etc.  There was a Morlock Healer.  The range of
	this Power is touch.  The healer's dice penalties subtract one
	effective Rank from this Power per die lost.  A Charisma + Medicine
	roll (difficulty 6) is required.
	
	Special Flaw: Painful Healing (1 pt. Flaw)- the mutant can heal other
	people, but the person being healed suffers excruciating pain as wounds
	close and bones knit back together.  Health levels are healed as
	normal, but the dice penalties accrued by the person being healed
	persist for the remainder of the scene.

	¥ Lethal damage, under the attentions of the Healer, will be recovered
	at a rate of one Health Level per day.  Aggravated damage will heal at
	the rate of one Health Level per week and the expenditure of one of
	the Healer's Willpower points.  Bashing damage heals at the rate of
	One Health Level every three hours.
	¥¥ Lethal damage will be recovered at a rate of one Health Level for
	every three hours.  Aggravated damage heals at a rate of one Health
	Level per day and the expenditure of a Willpower point.  Bashing damage
	heals at a rate of one Health Level an hour.  Upsets like the common
	cold, headaches, or the measles can be cured at a touch.
	¥¥¥ Lethal damage will be recovered at a rate of one Health Level per
	hour.  Aggravated damage heals at a rate of one Health Level per three
	hours and the expenditure of a Willpower point.  Bashing damage heals at
	a rate of one Health Level per minute.  More virulent diseases like
	influenza, mononucleosis, or smallpox can be cured.
	¥¥¥¥ Lethal damage will be recovered at a rate of one Health Level per
	minute.  Aggravated damage heals at a rate of one Health Level per
	three hours and the expenditure of a Willpower point.  Bashing damage
	heals at a rate of one Health Level per round.  Nasty diseases such as
	blindness, deafness, dysentery, cholera, or typhoid can be cured.
	Severed limbs, if held to the stump, can be rejoined if the Healer
	starts on them within an hour and spends a Willpower point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Lethal damage will be recovered at a rate of one Health Level per
	round.  Aggravated damage heals at a rate of one Health Level per hour
	and the expenditure of a Willpower point.  Bashing damage is recovered
	at a rate of three Health Levels per round.  Nastier diseases such as
	leprosy, meningitis, cancer, or AIDS can be cured.  Brain damage and
	paralyzation can also be cured over the course of a week or so. Severed
	limbs, if held to the stump, can be rejoined if the Healer starts on
	them within a day and spends a Willpower point.  Lost limbs or body
	parts can be completely regrown with the expenditure of one Willpower
	point per day, with the size of the limb determining the number of days
	necessary (A finger is one day; a hand is three days; an entire arm is
	two weeks; a leg is three weeks).  Eyes and other facial features can
	also be healed in this fashion.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Lethal damage will be recovered at a rate of three Health
	Levels per round.  Aggravated damage is healed at a rate of one Health
	Level per minute with the expenditure of a Willpower point, or one
	Level per week without the Willpower.  Bashing damage is healed in its
	entirety at a touch.  Some of the worst diseases (such as Ebola or
	bubonic plague) may be healed at a touch.  Lost limbs or body parts can
	be recovered in one-third the time recorded for Rank ¥¥¥¥¥.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Lethal damage is fully recovered in one round.  Aggravated
	damage is healed at a rate of one Health Level per round with the
	Willpower expenditure, or one Level per day without.  The nastiest of
	natural diseases (such as pneumonic plague) may be healed at a touch.
	Lost limbs or body parts can be recovered in one-half the time it took
	at Rank ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Lethal damage is fully recovered at a touch.  Aggravated
	damage is healed at a rate of one Health Level per round with the
	Willpower expenditure, or one Level every three hours without it. Any
	disease, including the techno-organic virus, nanite invasions, or the
	Legacy virus may be cured at a touch.  Lost limbs or body parts can be
	recovered (rather painfully) in a round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Aggravated damage heals at a rate of three Health Levels per
	round with the Willpower expenditure, or one Level per hour without it.
	Permanent damage can be healed with the expenditure of a point of
	permanent Stamina, over the course of a day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Aggravated damage is fully recovered in one round (no
	Willpower expenditure required).  Permanent damage can be healed with
	the expenditure of a point of Power Charge, over the course of a day.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Sense state- the healer can see at a glance (Perception + Medicine)
	how many Health Levels a person has, current and total.
	¥¥ Disease resistance- the healer is absolutely immune to diseases.
	¥¥ Invigorate- the touch of the healer can iron out cramps and the
	build-up of lactic acid, restoring any lost dice or penalties due
	to fatigue.
	¥¥ Dull pain- at a touch, the mutant can move the dice penalties of
	a patient up one wound category.  This is a Charisma + Medicine
	roll, difficulty of four, plus one for every Health Level of damage
	that the patient has taken.  This lasts a scene.
	¥¥ Hyper-medicine- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hyper-Medicine
	with Experience.
	¥¥ Poisons- the healer may purge poisons at the bashing damage rate,
	reducing the poison by one effective Rank of intensity per success
	over the indicated time span.
	¥¥¥ Anaesthetic- the healer can remove pain entirely by spending a
	point of Willpower, but this increases the patient's difficulties on
	all Dexterity pools by two, and increases soak difficulties by one.
	¥¥¥ Healing Trance- by use of a Charisma + Meditation roll, the mutant
	may heal himself as if applying the Power at two less Ranks than
	normal (thus, a mutant healer with Healing ¥¥¥ may heal himself as
	of Healing ¥).
	¥¥¥ Slow Process- one or more of a body's metabolic processes may be
	slowed greatly (in order to prevent a medicine from being quickly
	flushed out of the blood, or to slow the spread of a poison that is
	too powerful for the healer to treat).  This is a Manipulation +
	Medicine roll (diff varies, typically 7).  Coma or even suspended
	animation may be induced with five successes, difficulty 8.
	¥¥¥¥ Bioarchitect's Sight- the mutant may purchase the Power:
	Bioarchitect's Sight with Experience.

Health Proxy (Physical) [AL]
	This Power is regarded as one of the dirtiest tricks out there.  The
	mutant basically sets up a spatial/spiritual link between his own
	body and someone else's (within range).  All injuries that are
	inflicted upon the mutant are actually suffered by the target, and
	vice versa.  Thus, the mutant might be stabbed by a street punk,
	but it would be the punk's friend who would get cut, and not the
	mutant.  If the punk then turned around and punched his friend in
	the belly, it would be the mutant who doubled over.  Setting up or
	shutting down or exchanging a Health Proxy takes an action, and is
	a Manipulation check (diff 6).
	
	Variation: Dorian Grey- for only three Ranks, the mutant's health is
	linked to that of a single, specific object.  To damage him is to
	damage the object, and vice versa.  If the object loses all of its
	health levels through attacks on him, the mutant takes a nasty shock
	(-2 to all dice pools), and can then be attacked directly.  If the
	mutant is attacked through the object directly, he dies when his last
	health level is gone.  The object (be it a painting, sculpture, or car)
	may be repaired as normal for an object of its type, but not replaced. 
	The mutant is entitled to purchase extra health levels for it, as the
	Power, with Experience points.
	
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can choose to link his body with someone else's
	body.  This person must be living, and within visual range.  This
	Power applies to physical damage only, and not telepathic or
	empathic attacks (or the like).  The link immediately cuts out if
	the Proxy dies.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Sight exchange- the mutant can exchange senses with his 
	'friend', allowing him to see or smell things that might not
	otherwise be obvious.
	
	Health Proxy/Healing Factor Combination Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥/¥¥ Healing Proxy - While linked to another via Health Proxy the
	mutant is capable of loaning her healing abilities to the target.
	However the mutant herself is unable to benefit from the effects of her
	Healing Factor until the link is ended.

Hedge Magick (Mental) [AH]
	With this ability, the mutant may learn to employ the ritual magick
	that some other denizens of the World of Darkness employ.  The
	Scarlet Witch has learned to use hedge magick.  The mutant is considered
	to have an affinity for Hedge Magick, and may purchase as many paths
	and rituals as her time and experience points allow.  A mutant with
	this power may purchase the Awareness Talent, the Cosmology Knowledge,
	and the Rituals Knowledge.  See Ascension's Right Hand and World of
	Darkness: Sorcerer for more information about Ritual Magick.  The
	roll required will vary.
	
	¥ Level one magick- the mutant may learn first-level rituals and the
	first level abilities of any path.
	¥¥ Level two magick.
	¥¥¥ Level three magick.
	¥¥¥¥ Level four magick.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Level five magick.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Identify magick- the mutant can distinguish between hedge magick and
	True Magick at a glance (Perception + Hedge Magick)
	¥ Magick Detection- the mutant may purchase the Power: Detection
	(Magick) with Experience; this allows her to detect the casting of
	any spell, can reveal enchanted items, and sometimes even reveals a
	'spoor' when powerful magick has been used in the area.
	¥¥¥ Eldritch attack- the mutant may purchase the Power: Eldritch Bolt
	with Experience.

Heightened Reflexes (Physical) [PN]
	Your mutant sees an attack launched, and gets there before it.  A mutant
	with this Power has a blazing reaction time, even if he may not be able
	to move any faster than a normal human.  This makes him difficult to
	surprise, and hard to hit.  Good luck.  The Grifter of Wildstorm seems to
	have this Power.  This Power is applied AFTER Dice Pools are split.
	No direct roll is required to activate this Power.
	
	¥ One extra die to all Dodge, initiative, blocking, and parrying dice
	pools.
	¥¥ Two extra dice to all Dodge, initiative, blocking, and parrying dice
	pools.
	¥¥¥ Three extra dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Four extra dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five extra dice
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Difficulties to Dodge, initiative, blocking, and parrying are
	decreased by one (minimum diff of two); six extra dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ One automatic success to all affected pools; seven extra dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Difficulties for all affected pools are reduced by two; eight
	extra dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Two automatic successes to all affected pools; nine extra
	dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulties for all affected pools are reduced by three;
	three automatic successes; ten extra dice.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Cobra's Egg- by filling his mind with a sequence of possibilities,
	the mutant may dupe enemies using Combat Telepathy or X-Factoring who
	are reading his thoughts-- until it's too late for their own reflexes
	to react to what he actually does.  Wits + Heightened Reflexes to
	enter this state of mind (diff 10 - the mutant's Willpower).
	¥ Quick Correction- any Athletics roll related to balance that the
	mutant fails can be retried in the same round at +1 difficulty.
	¥ Switch Gears- the mutant can change his declared action once in a
	round without increasing the difficulty for the second action; this
	makes for a powerful feint.
	¥¥ Asp's Stare- by making a quick series of jerking feints and smooth
	motions when he's won initiative, the mutant can intimidate his
	opponent into making a false motion (Dexterity + Intimidation, diff of
	the opposing mutant's Wits + Brawl, Melee, or Martial Arts).  The
	opponent goes first, but at +2 difficulty.
	¥¥ Asp's Strike- when reversing an opponent's maneuver using Brawl,
	Melee, or Martial Arts, the mutant's difficulty is reduced by one.
	¥¥ Cobra-quick- the difficulty to dodge one of the mutant's attacks
	is increased by one.
	¥¥ Copperhead Road- because of his explosive reflexes, on the first
	round of any chase or run involving contested Dex + Athletics rolls
	(not versus enemies with Hyper-Speed or the Enhanced Movement stunt for
	Mega-Dexterity) the mutant is considered to have one auto-success
	per Rank in this Power, so long as he does not fail or botch without
	these extra successes.
	¥¥¥ Better Late Than Never- the mutant gets an action even in a
	round in which he botches his initiative roll (admittedly, he
	goes last).
	¥¥¥ Copperhead Twist- even while under partial restraint, the mutant
	can twitch any mobile part of his body out of the way at lightning
	speed.  He may dodge many attacks at no penalty (attacks targeting
	portions of his body that are totally immobile are not subject to
	this), though his maximum dice pool for this will not be greater than 
	that of his Dex + Athletics.
	¥¥¥ Double Cobra- if the mutant splits his dice pool to feint (not
	using Switch Gears, above), the difficulty to dodge, block, or soak
	his attack that round is increased by the number of successes he got
	on the feint.
	¥¥¥ Mega-Wits- the mutant may purchase the Power: Mega-Wits with
	Experience.
	¥¥¥¥ Iron Cobra- if the mutant misses a dodge roll, he may nevertheless
	add his Heightened Reflexes dice pool to his soak roll, twitching his
	body at the last possible moment.
	¥¥¥¥ Sidewinder's Sway- The mutant's reactions are so quick that he can
	take a second, defensive action in a round if he does nothing but parry
	or dodge in the following round.

Hex Power (Social/Mental) [AL]
	A variation on the Luck/Probability Manipulation Power, the Hex is
	a bad-luck curse that varies in intensity from the irritating to the
	lethal.  The Black Cat and the Scarlet Witch each had a variation of
	this power, though Felicia's was supposedly fake.  This curse affects
	the opponents of the mutant, and may either be directed or general
	in scope.  The mutant does not pick the effect, though the circumstances
	may sometimes allow her to make a prediction.  A Charisma + Hex
	Power roll (difficulty of the Rank of the effect + 4) fuels the
	effect.
	
	¥ Minor irritating coincidences (your pants fall down, your high heel
	breaks, all the mosquitoes attack you, etc.)  At worst, the target
	suffers from a temporary +2 difficulty to perform some action, or
	perhaps must make a check to avoid losing an action.
	¥¥ Guns jam up in your hands, the floor crumbles under your feet,
	things fall on you, ropes break, etc.  At worst, the target loses an
	action, suffers from a temporary +4 difficulty to perform some action,
	or takes up to 2 Health Levels of damage (aggravated) or 4 Levels of
	non-aggravated damage.
	¥¥¥ Water main lines burst around you, heavy objects sail off of
	fast-moving cars toward you, guns backfire, technology fails.
	At worst, the target loses an entire round, or takes up to 3 Health
	Levels of damage (aggravated) or 5 Levels of non-aggravated damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Gas mains burst, windows shatter, walls fall onto you, and
	your plane ceases to work in flight.  Whoops.  At worst, the target
	is stunned for (6 rounds - Stamina), or takes up to 4 Health Levels of
	damage (aggravated) or 6 Levels of non-aggravated damage.  Potentially
	lethal situations (like the plane seizing up) are also possible.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Buildings collapse on you, your lungs collapse, a crack opens up
	beneath your feet, your powers feed back, you suffer a stroke, or some
	other truly hideous happenstance.  At worst, the target suffers up to
	5 Health Levels of aggravated damage, or 7 levels of non-aggravated
	damage.  Death-traps sometimes turn up.  Advantages are often
	neutralized, and weaknesses are exploited.  Have a nice day.

	Variation: Curse of Ill Luck*- Rather than directly manipulating
	probability, the mutant is surrounded by a vortex of misfortune.  It
	can be turned on and off, but typically does not discriminate between
	friend and enemy.  For an additional 5 freebie points per Rank (and 2 x
	current in Experience) the mutant may select her targets.  The Black 
	Cat had this version.
	
	¥¥ Those who surround you are seized by bad fortune, as of Hex Power, but 
	their own ineptitude seems to damn them as often as coincidence.  Botch
	range is extended to 1-2.  The range of the effect is 10 feet.
	¥¥¥ The range of the effect is 40 feet.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is line-of-sight (both the mutant's and the other's).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The botch range is 1-3.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The botch range is reduced again to 1-2, but victims also botch
	on tens.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Contagion- the mutant can give one person the equivalent of a 'bad
	luck disease'.  This means that bad stuff will continue to happen to
	the mutant (at a maximum Rank of two levels lower than the mutant's
	maximum) sporadically, and this effect is catching.  Everyone that the
	mutant talks to (assuming they do not have some sort of luck-affecting
	power or magickal defense) will 'catch' this disease, being affected 
	sporadically by bad luck effects of one Rank lower than the original
	carrier.  If applicable, these unfortunately also become infectious,
	spreading the disease at one Rank lower than the one they have, and so
	on.

Horror Factor (Social/Mental) [AL]
	This is not a featherweight power, to say the least.  The ability to
	create terror and revulsion in others is what this Power grants to the
	mutants that have it.  In combination with a Power like Psychic
	Vampirism, the Horror Factor can be a serious drain on your opponents'
	ability to function.  This Power is activated by spending a Willpower
	point and lasts one scene.  No concentration is required.  If an
	opponent is paralyzed with fear, this lasts for 10 rounds - Willpower
	unless someone forcibly gets the victim to move.  Fainting lasts a
	scene unless the fainter has a Healing Factor (then it lasts a round).
	
	Special Flaw: Eye Contact (2-point Flaw)- eye contact must be made
	between the mutant and the target before the fear effect will work.
	
	Special Flaw: No Respite (3-point Flaw)- the mutant cannot shut off
	his Horror Factor.  Ever.  While this means that he can keep his
	Willpower points, it will probably put a crimp on his personal life.
	[AN]
	
	¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 6) or flee.  Even if the
	target stays, he suffers a one-die penalty to all dice pools.  Only
	one target is affected.
	¥¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 7) or flee.  A one-die
	penalty to those who stay.  Up to three targets at a time.
	¥¥¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 6) or be paralyzed with
	horror.  A second check (diff 8) must be made to avoid fleeing.  A
	two-dice penalty to those who stay.  Up to ten targets at a time.
	¥¥¥¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 7) or be paralyzed with
	horror.  A second check (diff 9) must be made to avoid fleeing.  A
	two-dice penalty to those who stay.  Up to thirty targets at a time.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 6) to avoid fainting.  A
	2nd check (diff 8) must be made to avoid being paralyzed with horror. 
	A third check (diff 9) must be made to avoid fleeing.  A three-dice
	penalty to those who stay.  Anyone within line of sight is affected.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 7) to avoid fainting.  
	A second check (diff 8) must be made to avoid being paralyzed with
	horror.  A 3rd check (diff 9) must be made to avoid fleeing.  Five dice
	penalty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Target must make a Willpower check (diff 4) to avoid having
	a stroke, in addition to the checks described above.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Stroke check is diff 5.  Target needs two successes in each
	category.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Stroke check is diff 6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Target must get three successes in each check.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ The Shakes- if the target doesn't make multiple successes on the
	check to freeze, he can nevertheless engage in no physical action
	with a difficulty higher than six.
	¥¥¥ Visions- the target, when he gazes upon the mutant, sees that one
	thing which he fears the most.  This will either raise or lower the
	difficulty to resist all the effects by one, depending on the nature
	of the relationship.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Reinforcement- if the mutant spends a point of Willpower, he
	can redouble his efforts, forcing a victim who has already made his
	checks that round to make another set.

Hyper-Ability (Physical/Social/Mental) [PN]
	Whatever the source of this Power, the mutant is talented, skilled, or
	knowledgeable in a certain field beyond the ken of normal humans.  Each
	Rank in a Hyper-Ability allows the mutant to add her Rank to the dice
	pool for all rools associated with the corresponding Talent, Skill, or
	Knowledge.  Thus, a mutant with Hyper-Brawl ¥¥¥ and a Brawl score of 3
	rolls six dice and subtracts 2 from all difficulties, as shown below:

	¥ Add one to the dice pool of the associated Ability.  Difficulties
	to use the associated Ability are reduced by 1 (difficulty six
	becomes difficulty five).
	¥¥ Add two to the dice pool of the associated Ability.  Difficulties
	to use the associated Ability are reduced by 1.  These reductions are
	not cumulative.
	¥¥¥ Add three to dice pools.  Difficulties are reduced by 2.
	¥¥¥¥ Add four to dice pools.  Diff -2.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Add five to dice pools.  Diff -3.
		
	The mutant is incapable of botching any roll that has the Hyper-Ability
	in its pool, though failure is still possible.
	
	Note that the Storyteller rules on whether a particular Hyper-Ability
	is Physical, Social, or Mental in nature.  It can be any combination.
	However, abilities like Dodge or Brawl are more Physical, Expression
	and Disguise are more Social, Meditation and Lores are more Mental. 
	Some may be a combination (Repair might be Physical/Mental, while
	Bureaucracy might be Social/Mental).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Trivial rolls- any roll that is difficulty 5 or less (adjusted) is
	considered to automatically succeed (with one success).  The mutant has
	the option to roll if desired.
	¥¥ No Contest- the mutant's skill is such that (on all contested
	rolls involving the ability) the opponent's difficulty is increased
	by the mutant's Rank in this Power.
	¥¥¥ High Stakes- the mutant ignores all ones on any roll utilizing
	the ability whenever he spends a point of Willpower.

Hyper-Evasion (Physical) [AN]
	Like Spider-Man, a mutant with this Power has an almost uncanny ability 
	to avoid blows. Beyond speed, beyond reflexes, beyond perception, the
	mutant can twist and turn to avoid several blows at once. He is as 
	difficult for many opponents together to defeat as he is for a single 
	one.  The roll associated with this Power is Wits + Dodge.

	¥ The mutant gets one automatic Evasion roll (Wits + Dodge) per round 
	without splitting his dice pool.
	¥¥ The mutant can elect to Evade rather than attack, in which case he 
	gets one Wits + Dodge roll per Rank, plus one (for his action).
	¥¥¥ The mutant gets one automatic Evasion roll per opponent per round.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can elect to make one Wits + Dodge roll, and have it 
	apply against one attack per opponent for the rest of the round. This 
	can be declared after the first roll, but not the second one.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant gets an automatic Evasion roll per attack against him 
	(assuming that he is aware of it).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Twisty- the mutant may increase his Athletics and Acrobatics Skills
	beyond the fifth Rank with Experience.

Hyper-Intake/Expulsion (Physical) [PL or AL]
	This is the strange ability to "suck in" a great breath, and then
	expel it again with great force.  A mutant with this Power can take in
	many cubic metres of air, compressing it as it passes into his lungs,
	in a moment.  One hopes that he isn't punched in the gut at that
	point!  In any case, this usually doesn't require a roll- but it would
	be Strength + Hyper-Intake/Expulsion (diff 6) if one seemed necessary.
	A Dex + Directed Blast (diff 4 or more) will be needed if the mutant
	wants to hit a particular target.  The gust itself may well be as
	strong as a hurricane by the time it is expelled.  The mutant may
	always choose to expel the matter harmlessly (at a lesser speed).

	Variation: Stomach*- For double cost, rather than breathing in air,
	this mutant's stomach serves as a powerful compressor, and he may take
	in (swallow) many cubic metres of any substance he chooses.  He has a
	powerful enough force of suction that a liquid or gas will enter
	quickly.  He may have to take in solids the old-fashioned way.  In any
	case, the stomach has the power (disgusting though it may be) to expel
	the matter again at great speed.  This can actually deliver up to two
	Health Levels of damage per Rank (rather than the damage listed) if
	the matter is solid or liquid.  Cut the range limit on the Power by a
	factor of 10 for liquid or solid materials.

	Merit: Cooling- For 5 extra freebie points, the mutant can naturally
	cool the gas he takes in, until it is remarkably frigid.  This happens
	automatically; he takes no damage from this.  Targets of his breath
	may well take damage, however; ponds will tend to freeze over, etc. Up
	to one Health Level of cold damage per Rank can be inflicted on
	anything that is easily harmed by cold (such as an animal).  This
	damage decreases by one Rank per range category.

	Merit: Heating- For 5 extra freebie points, the mutant can super-heat
	the gas he takes in, until it is like the blast of a furnace.  This
	happens automatically, and he takes no damage from it.  The breath
	will be enough to boil off water at close range, and perhaps even set
	alight easily flammable materials.  Up to one Health Level of heat
	damage per Rank can be inflicted with this Power.  This merit can be
	combined with the Cooling merit; the mutant may choose each time
	whether the blast is hot or cold.  This damage decreases by one Rank
	per range category.

	¥ The mutant can absorb up to twenty cubic metres of air;  This
	radically increases the amount of time that the mutant can hold his
	breath (up to two hours).  It is expelled with a force of about 10
	m/s2, and has a range of about 30 metres.
	¥¥ The mutant can absorb about forty cubic metres of air.  It is
	expelled with a force of about 20 m/s2, has a range of about 60
	metres, and will inflict one Health Level of incidental damage against
	anything caught in its blast.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb up to sixty cubic metres of air.  it is
	expelled with a force of about 30 m/s2, has a range of about 200
	metres, and will inflict three Health Levels of incidental damage out
	to the range of 60 metres, and then one Health Level out to the limit
	of its range.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb up to eighty cubic metres of air.  It is
	expelled with a force of about 40 m/s2, has a range of about 500
	metres, and will inflict five Health Levels of incidental damage out
	to 60 metres, three to 200 metres, and one to the limit of its range.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb up to one hundred cubic metres of air. It
	is expelled with a force of about 50m/s2, has a range of about 2
	kilometres, and will inflict seven Health Levels of incidental damage
	to 60 metres, five to 200 metres, three to 500 metres, and one to the
	limit of its range.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Mouth-to-mouth Suffocation- the mutant may drain all of the air out
	of an airtight chamber (or a person's lungs) with a diff 6 Strength +
	Hyper-Intake/Expulsion roll.  To draw the air out of a person's lungs,
	the mutant must make a seal (i.e., must be kissing the subject and
	pinching his nose, for example).

Hyper-Invention* (Mental) [AH]
	Like the leader of X-Factor, Forge, the mutant has the ability to
	build normal machines and more incredible ones with amazing facility.
	Of course, his ability to do so depends on the level of his Science
	Knowledge, his Technology Skill, and his Repair skill, but it is easy
	for a mutant with Hyper-Invention to improve these abilities.
	Hyper-Speed cuts down the time frame by 1/2, while Mechanist's Sight
	cuts it by 3/4.  A combination of the two cuts down the time by 6/7.
	Mega-Intelligence cuts down the Resources required by one dot. Any
	power imitated that costs double increases the time by a factor of
	three and the cost by two Ranks.  Several rolls are required to use
	this Power, including Intelligence + Hyper-Invention to come up with
	the idea, Intelligence + Science to figure out how it would work,
	Intelligence + Technology to draw up the plans, and Dexterity + Repair
	or Dexterity + Fine Control to actually build the device.  The
	difficulty depends on the complexity of the device.
	
	When the device is nearly complete, the mutant must spend Experience to
	get it working, at a cost of 3 points for the first Rank, or 2 x Rank
	(whichever is higher).  This is true for each blueprint; once the
	mutant knows how to make a device, he may manufacture as many as his
	Resources allows (no further XP cost).  Double-cost Powers are (as
	always) double-cost.
	
	If several Powers or effects are to be incorporated into one device,
	there must be a final development process to simulate that
	incorporation (requiring the standard Int + Science, Int + Tech, Dex +
	Fine Control or Repair), though this does not necessarily add any extra
	time or money requirements to the processes.  Only if one of these
	rolls is inadequate will a full-cost process be required (to simulate
	extra development time to figure out why your components are not
	meshing the way your notes seemed to imply).
	
	¥ The mutant may, with Resources ¥¥ backing him, create an invention
	that has the powers equivalent to a rank one Talisman of any of the
	Spheres of Correspondence, Forces, Life, Matter, or Prime. Takes one
	week to complete.  Technology and Repair cost only 1 x current.
	¥¥ Requires Resources ¥¥¥, can create a rank two Talisman in two
	weeks.  Also Entropy.  Science only costs 1 x current.  The mutant
	may duplicate most Social Powers.
	¥¥¥ Requires Resources ¥¥¥¥, can create a rank three Talisman in
	four weeks.  Also Mind.  The mutant may duplicate some Physical
	Powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Requires Resources ¥¥¥¥¥, can create a rank four Talisman in
	eight weeks.  Also Spirit.  The mutant may duplicate some Mental
	Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Requires Resources ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥, or ten Resources ¥¥¥¥¥.  Can
	create a rank five Talisman in four months.  Also Time.
	
	Examples:
	Forge, the darling of X-Factor, decides to create some butt-
	kicking Body Armour for Sabretooth.  He decides to make a powerful
	Rank 4 Body Armour, which requires Resources ¥¥¥¥¥.  Since Forge
	has Mechanist's Sight, the time to complete the work (normally
	two months) is reduced to two weeks.  If Forge did not have Science,
	Technology, and Repair at ¥¥¥¥ or higher, he could not make this
	armour.  It would also cost (4 x 2) 8 Experience.
	
	Doom, that nasty fellow, decides to build himself a Time Platform,
	based on an Energy Absorption/Conversion (Time Travel) power.  It is
	a good thing that Doom has the Knowledge: Nuclear Physics to supply
	the reactor to power the $#^@ thing!  This device contains the Powers
	Energy Emission (Beta Radiation*) ¥¥¥¥ [to simulate the reactor] and
	Energy Absorption/Conversion (Time Travel*) ¥¥¥¥¥, and Doom threw in
	Flight ¥¥¥ and Forcefield ¥¥¥¥ just for good measure.  Ug.  This will
	take six months for the reactor, one year for the time travel, one
	month for the flight, and two months for the forcefield.  If Doom did
	not have Mega-Intelligence, it would take Resources ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ to build;
	however, (lucky guy) he does, so it only takes Resources ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥.
	Good thing he's king of Latveria!  A total of 21 months, of at least
	six hours work a day.  It would take Forge 21 weeks to design and
	build, but a full Resources ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥, ten Resources ¥¥¥¥¥ ¥, or a
	numbing 100 Resources ¥¥¥¥¥.  Ouch.  In any case, this will cost (4 x 2
	x 2) 16 Experience for the reactor, (5 x 2 x 2) 20 Experience for the
	Time Travel, (3 x 2) 6 Experience for the Flight, and (4 x 2) 8 XP for
	the Forcefield, for a total of 50 Experience.

Hyper-Leaping (Physical) [PN]
	This bizarre power allows the mutant to make huge, sprawling leaps
	and land, unharmed.  It is not only a travel power, but it also
	guarantees that the mutant has enormously powerful legs, and dense
	bones that can absorb great strain.  So long as you land on your
	feet, you can fall from great distances and take no damage.  The
	Hulk and the Toad have Hyper-Leaping.  Normally, a Strength +
	Athletics roll is required to jump, though a Dexterity + Athletics
	may be required for tricky landings, etc.
	
	¥ The mutant can jump 10 feet into the air, or 30 feet across, from
	a standing position.  Normal (Str + 1) kick damage.  At a run, you
	can jump half again that height and distance.
	¥¥ 20-foot vertical, 60-foot horizontal leaps.  Kicks do Str + 2
	damage. 1 automatic soak from falling damage.
	¥¥¥ 50-foot vertical, 150-foot horizontal leaps.  Kicks do Str + 3
	damage.  2 automatic soak from falling damage.
	¥¥¥¥ 100-foot vertical, 300-foot horizontal leaps.  Kicks inflict
	Str + 4 damage.  3 automatic soak from falling damage.  Bones
	virtually unbreakable.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 300-foot vertical, 1000-foot horizontal leaps are possible.
	Kicks inflict an incredible Str + 5 damage.  5 automatic soak from
	falling damage.  One automatic damage success in Brawling from the
	heaviness of your bones.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ 1000-foot vertical, mile-long horizontal leaps are possible.
	Kicks inflict Str + 6 damage.  The mutant never takes damage from
	a fall.  The mutant's bones are unbreakable by any normal means.
	Two automatic damage when Brawling.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ One mile vertical, five mile-long horizontal leaps.  Kicks
	do Str + 7 damage.  Three automatic damage when Brawling.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Exit velocity (at least on Earth).  See ya!
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Balance- the mutant will rarely lose his balance, subtracting 2
	from the difficulties of all rolls that check balance.
	¥ Hopping attack- one die can be added to the mutant's brawling
	damage pool if he leaps to the attack.
	¥¥ Leap focus- the mutant can use his Hyper-Leap Rank instead of
	his Brawl score when jumping on or kicking a foe.
	¥¥¥ Serial Leaps- the mutant can perform one leaping attack each
	on as many foes as he has Ranks in this power.  The targets must
	alternate (first one, then another), but anywhere from two to
	the mutant's Rank in targets can be assaulted in a single round
	in this way, though no more attacks than a mutant has points in
	Dexterity are possible.  Use kicking damage.

Hyper-Scholarship (Mental) [PN]
	The province of Doctor Doom, Reed Richards, Mr. Sinister, the Beast,
	and the other great minds of the Marvel Universe, this simple power
	allows the mutant to raise any knowledge to levels exceeding five with
	experience points, and it also makes the purchase of knowledges with
	experience and freebie points less expensive.  There is no roll
	required.
	
	¥ The mutant can raise any knowledge to Level 6.  To improve a
	Knowledge with Experience requires only (1 x current) points, or one
	Freebie point.  A new Knowledge still costs 3 Experience.
	¥¥ Any Knowledge can be raised to level 7.
	¥¥¥ Level 8, plus the mutant automatically receives the Merit: Eidetic
	Memory if he did not already have it.
	¥¥¥¥ Level 9 Knowledges possible.  New knowledges cost only 2
	Experience points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Level 10 Knowledges.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mutant has one "shadow point" in all Knowledges.  New
	Knowledges cost only 1 Experience point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Mutant has two "shadow points" in all Knowledges.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Mutant has three "shadow points" in all Knowledges.
	Knowledges cost one point per dot.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Mutant has four "shadow points" in all Knowledges.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant has five "shadow points" in all Knowledges.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Library of the Mind- the mutant, when purchasing Knowledges with
	experience, may use his Power Rank in Hyper-Scholarship as a Library
	background.
	¥¥¥ High Intelligence- the mutant may purchase the power: Mega-
	Intelligence with experience, even if he did not start the game with
	that power.  This allows mutants who did not choose the Mental
	Category as their Primary to improve Intelligence beyond normal
	limits.

Hyper-Skill (Physical/Social) [PN]
	Some characters have been around for so long that they seem to be
	superhuman at almost everything they set their hands to.  Ra's al-Ghul,
	for example, seems to excel at almost anything you can name.  However,
	not all characters with this Power have to be ancient.  This simple
	Power allows the mutant to raise any Skill to levels exceeding five
	with experience points, and it also makes the purchase of Skills with
	experience and freebie points less expensive.  There is no roll
	required.
	
	¥ The mutant can raise any Skill to Level 6.  To improve a Skill with
	Experience requires only (1 x current) points, or one Freebie point.  A
	new Skill still costs 3 Experience.
	¥¥ Any Skill can be raised to level 7.
	¥¥¥ Level 8, plus the mutant automatically receives the Merit:
	Concentration if he did not already have it.
	¥¥¥¥ Level 9 Skills possible.  New skills cost only 2 Experience
	points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Level 10 Skills.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mutant has one "shadow point" in all Skills.  New
	Skills cost only 1 Experience point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Mutant has two "shadow points" in all Skills.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Mutant has three "shadow points" in all Skills.
	Skills cost one point per dot.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Mutant has four "shadow points" in all Skills.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant has five "shadow points" in all Skills.

Hyper-Speed (Physical) [AN]
	Hyper-Speed is the ability to move and perceive at a very high rate of
	speed- and actually survive the experience.  This usually confers a
	certain degree of invulnerability (since a hyper-fast punch using a
	normal fist would turn it into goo).  A character with hyper-speed
	almost never loses balance, and is not disoriented by teleportation.
	The X-treme and Quicksilver are two of Marvel's speedier mutants. Note
	that any other movement power (like Flight) substitutes the Hyper-Speed
	velocity for its own, if the former is faster, but see below.  There is
	no roll required under normal circumstances, though a Stamina +
	Athletics may be required for sustained exertion.
	
	¥ Run at 50 km/h, one auto soak against physical attacks.
	¥¥ Run at 100 km/h, one auto soak.
	¥¥¥ Run at 200 km/h, two auto soak.
	¥¥¥¥ Run at 500 km/h, two auto soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Run at 1000 km/h, three auto soak.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Run at Mach two, four auto soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Run at Mach five, five auto soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Run at Mach ten, six auto soak
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Run at sub-light, seven auto soak
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Speed Force (beyond light speed), eight auto soak.
	
	Extra actions: It is possible to use Hyper-speed to get extra actions
	in a round, much in the same way that Vampires use Celerity.  In order
	to get extra actions, the mutant must spend a point of Power Charge.
	The mutant gets up to his Rank in actions in so doing.  At Rank one,
	no extra action is possible.  At Rank two, the mutant can get one
	extra action (thus going twice in a round).  At Rank five, the mutant
	can get four extra actions (going five times in a round).  Only one
	point of Power Charge may be spent in this way per round.

	The mutant gets his full dice pool for these actions, and these pools
	may be split normally, if desired.  The single proviso is that extra
	actions cannot be combined with the use of high concentration Powers
	like Telepathy.  In any round that the mutant uses a high
	concentration Power, he can't spend Power Charge for extra actions.
	
	Hyper-Speed and other travel Powers: If our hero has a Power like
	Flight or Tunneling that increases movement rate, the mutant may, if
	desired, apply his incredible speed to those Powers.  Flight or Wings
	gain the full benefit, whereas the mutant will move while Tunneling at
	his Hyper Speed Rank - 2.  Note, however, that the mutant will have to
	make a control roll (typically Wits + Flight/Tunneling/etc.) if he
	wants to come to a sudden stop or make a sharp turn; he has the speed,
	but not the control...
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Automatic initiative successes- one per Rank.  No additional roll
	required.
	¥ Hyper-swim at up to 1/5 your top speed.
	¥¥ Speed Reading- Finish War & Peace in 20 seconds!  Of course, anything
	you speed-read can only be remembered for 24 hours.
	¥¥ Lower dodge difficulties by 2.  This Stunt does not function vs.
	other attackers moving at incredible speed.
	¥¥ Hyper Leap- purchase the Power: Hyper-Leaping with Experience.
	¥¥ Heightened Reflexes- your character may purchase the Power: Heightened
	Reflexes, even if he did not start the game with it.
	¥¥¥ Walk on water- cross the ocean, if you like!
	¥¥¥¥ Run straight up a wall!  You can do it!
	¥¥¥¥ Invisibility- vibrate very quickly, and your mutant can avoid
	being seen by anyone with normal eyes.  You can still be smelled,
	and the air displaced by your passing is still quite stiff.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Tornado generation- yep, you can make these just by running
	around in a circle fast enough.  They last one turn/success and can
	lift heavy objects (weight equal to the equivalent Rank of Mega-
	Strength).  They also inflict bashing damage equal to the mutant's
	successes on anyone caught within.
	
	Hyper-Speed/Rage Stunts:
	¥¥/¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Flash of Anger- the mutant may spend points of Rage in place
	of points of Power Charge to get extra actions.
	
	Hyper-Speed/Free Action Stunts:
	¥/¥ Smooth Running- Changes of medium or terrain (such as swimming or
	climbing) no longer decrease the mutant's speed.  Requires the Stunt:
	Hyper-Swim.

Hyper-Talent (Physical) [PN]
	Like Monet St. Croix, Gambit, or the Taskmaster, mutants with this
	Power have capacities beyond that of mortals, and excel in a variety of
	fields.  This simple Power allows the mutant to raise any Talent to
	levels exceeding five with experience points, and it also makes the
	purchase of Talents with experience and freebie points less expensive. 
	There is no roll required.
	
	¥ The mutant can raise any Talent to Level 6.  To improve a Talent with
	Experience requires only (1 x current) points, or one Freebie point.  A
	new Talent still costs 3 Experience.
	¥¥ Any Talent can be raised to level 7.
	¥¥¥ Level 8, plus the mutant automatically receives the Merit: Double-
	Jointed if he did not already have it.
	¥¥¥¥ Level 9 Talents possible.  New Talents cost only 2 Experience
	points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Level 10 Talents.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mutant has one "shadow point" in all Talents.  New
	Talents cost only 1 Experience point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Mutant has two "shadow points" in all Talents.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Mutant has three "shadow points" in all Talents.
	Talents cost one point per dot.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Mutant has four "shadow points" in all Talents.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant has five "shadow points" in all Talents.

Hyper-Temper (Social) [PN]
	Yep; your mutant is pretty much set.  Advantage Traits including
	Willpower, Rage, Gnosis, and Power Charge (but not Power Ranks, Actual
	Power Level, or Power Potential) may be increased beyond their normal
	maximums with this Power.  This Power works much like the Power: Extra
	Health Levels.  An extra point of Gnosis, Willpower, Rage, or Power
	Charge beyond ten costs ten Experience points, once this Power is
	bought.  The mutant may elect to pay this cost instead of the regular
	multiplier for these Advantages, though this is not cumulative with
	Merits such as Askani Training.  If they are being used in the game,
	other tempers (such as Courage, Instinct, Self-Control, etc. but NOT
	Humanity or other Paths) can also have twice as many points.

	Note that the maximum score for a temper may only be doubled; thus,
	Willpower may be increased to 20, while Courage may only be increased
	to 10.  The new maximum for Power Charge is double the mutant's Power
	Potential.

	¥ Make increases in selected Advantages at any time.

Hypnosis (Mental) [AH]
	Mesmero once dominated the whole of the X-men using this Power, which
	is similar to Telepathy in certain ways, but can only be resisted with
	raw Willpower.  Psychic Defenses are precious little use, as Hypnosis
	does not attack the mind directly.  Usually, Hypnosis takes the form
	of a hypnotic gaze, which must be met by the victim in order to bring
	her under control.  Banshee, however, has a hypnotic voice.
	
	Variation: Hypnotic Voice- for three Freebie points, the mutant can
	have a hypnotic voice, which will potentially mesmerize anyone who can
	hear it.  There is no language barrier; it is the modulation of the
	voice that is important in this case.  However, the victim must
	understand any commands in order to follow them.
	
	At any rate, once a victim is mesmerized, she will take simple
	commands from almost anyone (Manipulation + Expression, diff 6).  Most
	often, however, the hypnotist's voice will be the most convincing
	(Manipulation + Expression, diff 4).  If the mutant delivers a command
	that is especially repugnant to the victim, he gets a Willpower check
	to resist and break the trance; however, most hypnotists will be
	clever enough to alter the victim's perceptions so that the command
	seems rational and necessary. The system to take control of a victim
	is Charisma, Manipulation, or Appearance + Hypnosis (mutant's choice)-
	difficulty 6.  The victim can resist using Willpower (difficulty 6).
	
	¥ The mutant can induce a hypnotic state using props such as
	pendulums.  Putting a victim into a trance takes two rounds.  The
	victim must not be engaging in strenuous or distracting activity, or
	the trance will not take hold.
	¥¥ The mutant can induce a trance using props.  The victim cannot be
	distracted, as above.  Putting the mutant in a trance will take one
	round.
	¥¥¥ The mutant no longer requires props to put a victim into a trance.
	The victim cannot be distracted.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can put a victim who is not engaging in a mentally
	taxing activity in a trance.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can put people into trances regardless of
	distraction.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Induce Hallucination- the mutant can instill an irrational belief
	in the victim with a successful Manipulation + Expression (diff of
	the victim's Willpower).  An example- a belief that the victim's shoe
	is actually a telephone.
	¥¥¥¥ Post- Hypnotic Suggestion- the mutant can implant a suggestion
	in the victim's mind that will survive the termination of the trance.

Illusion Casting (Social/Mental) [AH]
	Several mutants have had powers of illusion; Nate Grey and Dazzler
	could construct visual illusions, while the Mastermind could make
	illusions through psychic domination (psionically induced
	hallucinations).  This Power covers a few more of the bases than
	either of these approaches.  For each dot in this Power, the mutant
	can affect one of the five senses with her illusions.  Simply
	disbelieving them does not negate their existence, though the
	target audience can certainly try to act as if the illusion were
	not there.  With the proper Stunts, the illusions can even move
	and perform complex actions.  A Perception + Illusion is required
	to construct an illusion- more successes equals a more convincing
	likeness.
	
	¥ Illusions may affect one of sight, hearing, or smell.
	¥¥ Illusions may affect two of sight, hearing, or smell.
	¥¥¥ Illusions may affect three of sight, hearing, smell, or 
	taste.
	¥¥¥¥ Illusions may affect four of sight, hearing, smell, taste,
	or touch.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Illusions may affect all five senses.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Illusions give off heat.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Illusions are complex enough to fool Microscopic Vision.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Illusions can fool 'sixth senses' such as Intuition
	and Combat Sense.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Illusions can fool evaluative senses such as Karma
	Perception.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Illusions can fool True Vision.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Illusory invisibility- the mutant 'blends in' and looks just like
	her surroundings.  Since she cannot see all the angles, this is
	rarely perfect, and distortion is often evident, but the mutant
	can add four dice to her Stealth pool with concentration.
	¥¥ Movement- illusions are capable of movement with this Stunt,
	though they may suffer from breakup or distortion if the mutant
	is not paying close attention.
	¥¥ Nausea- the mutant can induce nausea in a subject by creating
	an absolutely horrible smell.  The target will suffer a -1 die
	penalty to all actions.
	¥¥¥¥ Invigorate- the mutant can nullify a target's sense of touch,
	thereby removing her dice penalties due to pain with light
	concentration.

Immutable Pattern (Physical/Social/Mental) [PN]
	A curious (and difficult-to-detect) fact about a mutant with this
	Power is that he has what is known as an immutable pattern.
	Immortals also have this distinction, which tends to make certain
	mages and mutants very nervous when they are near.  Basically,
	this Power makes the mutant virtually immune to Life and Matter
	magicks, immune to Life Force draining, and impossible to turn
	into a duck.  The 'blueprint' that makes the mutant what he is
	cannot be changed or destroyed through manipulation.  No roll
	is required.

	* The mutant cannot be shapeshifted, unnaturally aged, turned
	into stone or plasma, or be forced to suffer any other radical
	change of state through interference.
	* This does not prevent the mutant from being lit on fire or
	stabbed or mind-controlled.  Those things are possible according
	to the mutant's pattern (unless he has other Powers that prevent
	those things!)
	* This also does not prevent the mutant from having his Powers
	dampened or amplified, though they cannot be taken away forever
	except through the most extraordinary means.
	* This does not mean that the mutant will re-grow his appendix
	if it is removed.  This is not a Healing Factor.
	* The mutant cannot take the Power: Hedge Magick, as it requires
	a change in the mutant's pattern to work many spells.
	* The mutant will not die from old age, though he can be killed
	in the normal way.  He does not age.
	* The character is incapable of taking permanent damage (see
	Karma Channeling), since that entails a change in pattern.

	¥¥¥ The mutant has a pattern that just ain't gonna change.  He
	has four automatic countermagick successes against any magickal
	effect that would alter his Pattern, and is immune to such
	Vampiric Disciplines as Vicissitude.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Bio-Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Power: Power
	Resistance (Body Manipulation) with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Thought Protection- any permanent change to a mutant's mind,
	like Memory Implants or Mental Blocks, are at +3 difficulty to
	create against the mutant.

Imp Creation [AH] (Social/Mental)
	This power calls on a very specific place in the astral plane (high
	umbra) where imaginative creatures exist, and manifests them here on
	this plane.  The Darkness has a variant of this power. The standard
	system for this is Intelligence + Imp Manifestation (difficulty 8). 
	This is an extended action (takes about 5 minutes). If the mutant is
	willing to take extra time, every additional five minutes offers a -1
	difficulty (minimum diff of 3).  The mutant must have a free 'slot',
	and also have purchased the 'New Imp' Power Stunt.  The stunt must be
	purchased once for each imp. The first success offers three Health
	levels, one dot each for all Attributes, 1 willpower and three dots to
	spend on the imp's Abilities. Extra successes can be distributed among
	Health levels, Attributes, Abilities and Willpower (one success per
	dot).  The Imp cannot have higher stats than the mutant's Rank in this
	Power.  The player, at the time that the imp is imagined, should
	describe (or better yet, draw) the imp, because the appearance of the
	creature will be important later.  Typically, the imp is manifested
	(grown) out of an object in the mutant's immediate area. 

	The roll to manifest an imp is Intelligence + Imp Creation. The base
	difficulty is 9 if the manifesting-object bears no resemblance to the
	imp the mutant is trying to manifest.
	
	Difficulty reductions are possible based on the object's similarity to
	imp:
	-1 vague resemblance (carved outline)
	-2 clear resemblance (painting)
	-3 sculpture (not detailed enough to get -4)
	-4 almost exact resemblance, only cosmetic differences
	-5 resembles exactly
	
	Five successes offers instant manifestation; the imp may act that turn.
	Four successes- the imp manifests in one turn.
	Three successes- two turns.
	Two successes- three turns.
	One success- five turns.
	
	* The imp lasts one scene and morphs back to its manifesting object.
	* The imp will not have greater mass than the manifesting object.
	* An imp cannot be manifested in multiples; it may only have one body.
	Multiple bodies require multiple imps.
	
	Variation*: Energy Manifestation- the imp is manifested out of energy
	as per Energy Absorption/Conversion.  The mutant absorbs energy as if
	he had the same Rank in that Power; each damage die absorbed is
	considered an automatic success for the manifestation roll.  Imps may
	also be manifested out of ambient energy; this is a difficulty 9 roll
	(Intelligence + Imp Manifestation).
	
	Once the imp is manifested, the mutant must make a control roll; imps
	love to wreak mischief and havoc.  A Willpower roll (diff 6) must be
	successful after an imp is manifested to control it.  If multiple imps
	are created, then the mutant must garner multiple successes (one for
	each imp). Failure means that one or more imps is out of control
	(depending on how short the mutant fell).  The mutant can try to exert
	control each turn, but if he gathers fewer successes, then more imps
	may slip from his control... While an imp is not under control, the ST
	commands it.  A botch means the mutant can't even try to control the
	last imp that manifested; it will run free until the scene is up (and
	it reverts to its object.
	
	The imps also may receive a Power or two; these may be Physical or
	Social. The ST may allow double-cost Powers, though each Rank costs
	double (naturally).  The ST is within his rights to disallow any Power,
	and particularly double-cost ones.  Note that the Ranks of Power
	allowed the imps must be split among them; at Rank three, the mutant
	may have as many as seven imps at his beck and call, but they would
	have only 6 Ranks of Power between them.
	
	Special flaw: No control (3 pt)- this flaw negates this power's innate
	ability to control the imps.  Powers like "Voice of Command" and
	telepathy still work and can be used to control the imps.
	
	Special merit: Total control (3 pt)- a mutant with this merit succeeds
	automatically with his control roll (automatic successes equal to the
	mutant's current willpower).
	
	¥ 2 imp slots, 2 ranks of power and one imp
	¥¥ 5 imp slots, 4 ranks
	¥¥¥ 7 imp slots, 6 ranks
	¥¥¥¥ 9 imp slots, 8 ranks
	¥¥¥¥ 11 imp slots, 10 ranks
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ New imp- with this stunt the mutant can fill a slot with an imp
	she/he made-up.  The slot don't have to be empty, the new imp may
	replace an old one.  The mutant requires one 'copy' of this Stunt per
	slot, but does not need to relearn it to fill an old slot with a new
	imp.   To even try to use this stunt the mutant must have the imp
	totally clear in mind (what it looks like, how it acts and what it can
	do).
	¥¥ Mental command- Verbal orders are not necessary.  The orders are
	given telepathically.
	¥¥¥ Permanence- The mutant may spend a point of temporary Willpower to
	make a manifestation permanent (until it is slain).  Note that a
	permanent imp is always the last one that the mutant loses control
	over.  He only loses control over it on a botched Willpower roll.
	¥¥¥ Shared Senses- allows the mutant to share the imp's senses.  To
	attune to a particular imp, roll Perception + Imp Creation (diff 7).
	¥¥¥¥ Favourite- this stunt is useable only on one imp at a time.  The
	mutant chooses one imp.  To manifest this imp will only require low
	concentration [AL] and at -4 difficulty.  It costs one permanent
	willpower to favour an imp.  If the mutant designates another imp as
	"Favourite", the new imp replaces the old one.
	¥¥¥¥ Improvised manifestation- the mutant can "awaken" a sculpture's
	inner imp and manifest (diff 7) it using the sculpture as manifesting
	object.  The control roll is at diff 8 (the mutant does not know the
	imp, he isn't the true creator of it).  The ST is the one who
	distributes extra successes and power ranks.

Indetectible to Machines (Social) [AN]
	The X-Men had this Power after passing through the Siege Perilous-
	at least until some writer or other decided that it sucked and it
	sort of faded away.  Any technological device that has detection
	as its function (or one of its functions) like cameras, the sensory
	arrays of robots, X-ray machines, metal detectors, etc. will not
	register the mutant as being 'there'- nor his personal effects.
	No roll is required.

	¥ The mutant cannot be perceived by machines, though he is
	perfectly visible to ordinary vision.  This Power does not prevent
	the mutant from being targeted in a rifle scope.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Concentration- the mutant can become visible to machines with
	an act of will.
	¥ Touch and Go*- if the mutant takes hold of someone and spends
	a Willpower point, she too will be indetectible to machines until 
	the contact is broken.

Information Manipulation* [AL] (Mental)
	The Drummer has this Power, which allows him to access and change all
	sorts of information, particularly electronic information.  In essence,
	the mutant may delete, augment, obscure, or in other such respects
	alter the contents of certain materials.  He can usually detect the
	presence of information on a successful Perception + Info Manipulation
	roll (difficulty typically 6)-- this is restricted to a rough range of
	line-of-sight.  Otherwise, it may be detected as it would be for most
	people (reading messages in a chat group, for example, or listening to
	a CD).  Multiple successes refines his knowledge of the medium (its
	exact location, what form it takes, and the like).  The actual process
	of manipulation requires a Wits + Info Manipulation roll (standard
	difficulty of 7), which may require an extended action for particularly
	detailed changes.
	
	This Power does not automatically grant the ability to read/receive
	the information that the mutant encounters, but she may change it in
	basic ways (deleting or scrambling it, for example) without such
	knowledge.  This use of the Power is always treated as requiring
	high concentration.
 
	¥ Magnetically stored media (such as audiotape, floppy discs and
	the like) may be manipulated.
	¥¥ Information stored on visual media, such as compact discs and
	digital video discs, may be manipulated.
	¥¥¥ The mutant may alter information embodied in electron streams and
	radio transmissions (such as television broadcasts, e-mail messages,
	or telephone conversations) while they are in transit.
	¥¥¥¥ Alter or imprint information that is visible to the naked human
	eye such as books, drawings, paintings, carvings, old records and the
	like.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Alien, advanced and unfamiliar information (stored or
	transmitted) can be manipulated.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Magic (either inscribed in situ or "in transit") may be
	manipulated.
 
	Sample Power Stunts: 
	¥ Osmosis - buy the Power: Altered Perceptions (Osmosis). 
	¥¥ Digital Osmosis- purchase the merit for Osmosis after having
	purchased the Power.
	¥¥ Layers- a message may be hidden inside another message with a
	Manipulation + Info Manipulation roll (diff 7).  Finding a hidden
	message will usually require a Perception roll (difficulty varies
	with the mutant's successes and how deeply he wanted to hide it).
	¥¥¥ Cyphering - buy the Power: Cyphering. 
	¥¥¥ Alter Senses - buy the Power: Alter Senses
	¥¥¥¥ Purchase the Database variant of the Power: Well of Knowledge
	with Experience.

Interspatial Warp (Social) [AL]
	With this Power (similar in many ways to Blink's abilities), a mutant
	can warp space around herself, changing its shape and topography in
	random ways.  Incoming attacks that depend on space (such as missile
	attacks, energy attacks, melee attacks, etc.) are redirected in an
	erratic manner, in effect giving the mutant an automatic dodge roll
	in addition to her own dodges.  Of course, outgoing attacks that rely
	on space are affected in the same way...  To set up an interspatial
	warp, the mutant must roll Charisma + Interspatial Warp.  The effect
	lasts until the mutant moves more than ten feet from his original
	location.
	
	¥ Missile attacks and other directed attacks (such as energy emission
	Powers) subtract two dice from their dice pools.
	¥¥ Melee and brawling attacks subtract two dice from their dice pools.
	Directed attacks subtract three dice.
	¥¥¥ Melee and brawling attacks subtract three dice, directed attacks
	subtract five dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Melee and brawling attacks subtract four dice, directed attacks
	subtract seven dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Melee and brawling attacks subtract six dice, directed attacks
	subtract nine dice.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant may create a 'cascading warp' around her body, in
	essence, a warp that folds and funnels space in a particular direction.
	She can use this to radically increase her foot speed (as if she had
	Hyper-Speed at Rank one).  She receives the benefit of the Accelerated
	Movement stunt automatically.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The speed increases to Rank two; additionally, the size of the
	'eye of the storm' can be increased to incorporate a small vehicle,
	like a motorcycle or a car.  Such a vehicle would be able to run at
	500 miles per hour or better (Rank four), whereas a simple bicycle
	might operate as if it had Rank three Hyper-Speed.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Distortion/Funhouse- in order to disguise herself, the mutant can
	choose to make the distortion 'fine grain', in order to scatter light.
	She will appear as a distorted blob to outside observers who rely on
	light to see.  This is a Manipulation + Interspatial Warp roll (diff
	is seven).
	¥¥ Movement- the character can move as fast as a slow walk and still
	maintain the warp.
	¥¥¥ Displacer effect- you can attempt to appear a certain distance
	away from your position (usually two feet or less in a particular
	direction) by trying to make adjustments to the 'egress point' of the
	light (where light will escape the warp).  This is a Charisma +
	Interspatial Warp roll (diff is 8; one success gives six inches of
	displacement).
	¥¥¥ Redirect- the mutant can attempt to send missile attacks or energy
	attacks off in a particular direction if the attack against her fails
	completely.  She gets a Dex + Interspatial Warp roll (diff 9) as a
	roll to hit against her chosen target.  This takes an action.
	¥¥¥¥ Extension- reshaping the field is possible, sending out 'pseudopods'
	that envelop other items or people (either protectively, or offensively),
	though the actual volume of area within the warp remains unchanged, so
	the warp itself will 'thin' toward the mutant's body along an adjacent
	area.
	¥¥¥¥ Focal Tunnel- requires Redirect and Extension.  This Stunt creates
	a small 'boom tube' between the mutant and another nearby location,
	greatly increasing the accuracy of missile exchange along the tube
	(such as small arms fire or thrown weapons).  Thrown items will
	actually bounce around within the tube if their arc would otherwise
	take them outside of it.  Difficulties to hit or throw accurately are
	reduced by 2.
	¥¥¥¥ Violent movement- Rather than the relatively gentle twisting that
	occurs when she starts up the warp (which may appear to distort the
	shape of objects but does them no harm), the edges of the warp are
	now a very dangerous place for large (and particularly, stationary)
	objects.  The mutant inflicts Rank damage on the object per round
	(lethal damage) if it is too massive for the field to pick up and whip
	around, or too large for the field to encompass.  This damage is
	only calculated as she moves; such objects that were in the area of
	the field when it is erected remain unaffected (and, as always, 'snap
	back' to their original shapes when the field is no longer around).
	Requires the Stunt: Movement.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Accelerated movement- Recurve along the edges of the field
	allows the mutant to move at normal speed without disrupting the warp.
	Requires the Stunt: Movement.

Invincible Defense/Iron Gate (Physical) [AL]
	Anyone who wishes to strike a mutant with this Power had best do it
	unawares, for he is extremely difficult to hit if he wishes to parry.
	In essence, any Dexterity + Brawl or Dexterity + Martial Arts roll
	(etc.) that the mutant makes for purposes of parrying an attack
	succeeds completely- that is, if the mutant has eight dice in his pool,
	then he automatically has eight successes to parry.  No roll is
	required.  Of course, attacks that cannot be parried (flame breath, for
	instance) must be avoided in the normal way.  The mutant need not split
	his dice pool to parry multiple attacks, assuming that parrying is the
	only action that he takes that round.  If he is doing anything else, he
	must split his dice pool as normal (though all of his parrying dice are
	still assumed to be successes).  Even ridiculous or nigh-impossible
	feats (such as parrying 100 chopsticks) can easily be accomplished with
	this Power.  The mutant may not use Hyper-Speed or Rage to get
	additional actions in any round in which he uses this Power (nor are 
	any other means effective).

	¥¥¥ The mutant's defenses are closed completely.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Ludicrous speed- so long as the object that he parries with is
	sturdy enough, the mutant may use this Power against firearms attacks.
	¥¥¥ No Criticals- the character is completely immune to called shots
	and critical hits, and only takes base damage (no damage pool for
	successes) from firearms.  He is immune to Fault D/E.
	¥¥¥ No Fear- the character is immune to any attempt to reduce her
	parrying dice pool with such Powers as Occlusion or as a result of
	reversal of Confidence Boost.  She may still be paralyzed or suffer due
	to health-related dice penalties.

Invisibility (Social) [AL]
	This is the ability to remain unseen under the closest possible visual
	scrutiny.  Light simply passes through the mutant, or it may bend
	around him without visible distortion.  A Willpower point must be spent
	to activate this Power.  In any case, this Power does not help the
	mutant to be silent, or scentless.  There are a number of nice
	implications, though-

	* While invisible, the mutant is completely invulnerable to light-based
	attacks. They just can't harm him.
	* The mutant can see perfectly even in absolute darkness.  He does not
	need light at all to see his surroundings (which is good, since
	otherwise he'd be blind whenever he turned invisible)
	* Light-based illusions cannot even be detected by the character when
	he is invisible (so he isn't fooled by them).  Telepathic illusions
	affect the character normally.

	Special Flaw: Blind Man's Bluff (3 point Flaw)- the mutant is totally
	blind whenever he is invisible.  Oops.

	¥¥¥¥ Invisibility- the mutant can turn invisible at will.  This adds 5
	to his Stealth dice pool, and opponents must use the Blindfighting
	Talent to brawl with him, or just raw Dex (at difficulty 9, in either
	case).

Invulnerability (Physical) [AN or PN]
	This much sought-after Power is the most aesthetic form of damage
	resistance.  Whether it is from hyper-dense flesh or whatever, the
	mutant simply stands up to punishment much better than average.  At
	high Ranks, he is almost impossible to injure.  Rogue and Juggernaut
	are the most notable Invulnerable characters.  No roll is required.
	Each point of Invulnerability that the character has increases the 
	number of successes required to affect him with Biomanipulation by 
	two.  This also applies to such Powers as Healing (Others) and Power
	Puppetry.

	¥ One automatic soak success, soak difficulty -1.  All aggravated
	damage is treated as lethal.  Because the body is so resistant to
	trauma, a mutant with Invulnerability heals at the rate of one Health
	Level per day.
	¥¥ Two automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -1.
	¥¥¥ Three automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -2.
	¥¥¥¥ Four automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -2.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -3.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten automatic soak successes, soak difficulty -5
	(minimum difficulty of 2).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Disease Resistance- the mutant will not suffer from most
	diseases.
	¥ Poison Resistance- most poisons will not affect the mutant.
	¥¥¥ Life Support- the mutant may purchase the Life Support Power with
	experience.

Iron Will (Mental) [PN]
	This useful power works much like the Vampiric Disciplines of Potence
	and Fortitude, but instead grants automatic successes on any Willpower
	check.  No mutant can have more Iron Will than permanent Willpower. 
	Furthermore, it decreases in effectiveness as the mutant spends
	temporary Willpower.  A mutant with an Iron Will of 3 and a Permanent
	Willpower of 5 gets three automatic Willpower successes, so long as he
	has at least 3 temporary Willpower.  At two points, he only gets 2
	successes, and when the last point of temporary Willpower is spent, he
	is out of luck.  If the mutant botches a Willpower roll and loses a
	point of Permanent Willpower, bringing the score below the Iron Will
	score, Iron Will is similarly reduced and must be brought back to its
	former level with experience points.  Charles Xavier, Magneto, and
	Wolverine are the best-known holders of an Iron Will.  No roll is
	required.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Concentrated Peace- the mutant's Meditation difficulties are
	reduced by one.
	¥¥ Focused Totality- instead of taking an automatic success, the
	character may elect to lower the difficulty of a roll by one with the
	expenditure of a point of Willpower.
	¥¥ Psychic Defenses- the mutant may purchase the Power: Psychic
	Defense, even if he did not start the game with that ability.
	¥¥¥ Grimace- with the expenditure of a point of Willpower, the mutant
	may ignore his dice penalties for a scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Grunt- the mutant may spend more than one point of Willpower per
	round; in fact, she may spend a number of points up to her Rank in
	Iron Will.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Fortitude- the mutant may elect to take damage to her Willpower
	score instead of her Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Recoil- any time the mutant takes a Health Level of damage, he
	receives a point of Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Shadow point- so long as does not spend any other Willpower that
	round, the mutant may enjoy the expenditure of one "shadow point" of
	Willpower on any one roll involving an attribute from the mutant's
	primary category (Physical, Social, or Mental).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Not Today- if the mutant gets supremely angry or determined 
	about something, he can declare, "not today".  For the rest of the
	scene, he may spend a point of Willpower to nullify or ignore any
	assault on him (be it Mental, Social, or Physical in nature), so
	long as doing so allows him to directly pursue the goal that he
	stated when he lost his temper.  This works even on attacks that are
	normally irresistible (the mutant could elect not to take any dice
	penalties from Horror Factor, for instance).

Janusian Mirror (Physical) [AN]
	This Power provides a stern protection against superior enemies,
	presenting them with a reflection of their own strengths.  When an
	enemy is faster, stronger, or hardier than the mutant, when he is more
	athletic or skilled, the possessor of this power will grow to match
	him.  Similar in some respects to Photographic Reflexes, but Janusian
	Mirror does not provide any permanent benefits.  It also has a wider
	range of effect.  A Perception + Janusian Mirror roll (difficulty of
	the opponent's Charisma + Subterfuge) will begin the process of change.
	Each rank of active Spirit Armour that the opponent has takes away a
	success from the mutant's judgment.  Note that this Power is partially
	empathic in nature, and the mutant must regard the other person as an
	opponent, enemy, or rival.
	
	¥ The mutant will begin to duplicate certain Attributes, if they are
	superior to his, as soon as an opponent uses a dice pool for that
	Attribute.  Initiative rolls, for example, allow a roll for Wits.  At
	this Rank, Strength, Dexterity, and Wits may be matched. This increase
	lasts a scene at most, or until the opponent is defeated.  One opponent
	may be matched at a time.
	¥¥ Stamina, Perception, and Athletics rolls may also trigger a mirror
	effect.
	¥¥¥ Brawl, Dodge, Martial Arts, Missiles, Melee, Climbing, and Swimming
	can also be duplicated.  If the mutant is facing two opponents, he may
	synch to the best abilities of each, as they are used, if they are
	superior to his own.
	¥¥¥¥ Strictly athletic Powers, such as Hyper-Leaping, Immovability,
	Hyper-Speed, Martial Arts Supremacy, or Iron Gate may be duplicated,
	though individual stunts may be beyond the mutant's ken.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Certain Physical Powers that offer the opponent a critical
	tactical advantage (such as certain Altered Perceptions-- for instance,
	if your mutant was fighting an enemy with Heat Imaging in a dark room)
	may be duplicated.  Only Powers that have an overt physically
	transformative effect (such as Wings, Body Weaponry, Tunneling, or Pain
	Immunity) may be so matched-- this does not include Healing Factor,
	Retributive Strike, Nexus Body, or the like.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Blurry Image- the mutant can not be 'read' by Photographic
	Reflexes.

Ju-Ju Focus (Social) [AN]
	Like Black Tom Cassidy, some mutants feel that their powers are
	more effective when channeled through a specially-crafted object.
	With this Power, belief becomes fact.  The object must be crafted
	with the utmost care, but when it is completed, it will increase
	the effectiveness of the mutant's social or mental Powers.  A
	different ju-ju focus must be constructed for each Power, and only
	the mutant himself may use these items.  Note that the bonuses
	granted by the ju-ju focus are NOT cumulative.

	¥ Difficulty (for damage OR attack) of the affected Power is
	reduced by one.
	¥¥ Difficulty to attack AND damage is reduced by one, or the 
	difficulty to resist the Power is increased by one.
	¥¥¥ The Power increases one Rank for purposes of range.
	¥¥¥¥ The Power increases one Rank for all intents and purposes
	when channeled through the ju-ju focus (not above Rank 5).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's Power Charge increases by one as long as the
	mutant holds the Juju focus.  This is not cumulative with multiple
	Juju foci.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Temporary points of Willpower, Power Charge, Rage, Gnosis,
	and other expendable attributes related to the focus may be stored
	inside it; a Manipulation + Ju-Ju Focus roll (diff 6) and an action
	is required to retrieve these points; a difficulty 7 roll will
	spend them directly.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Difficulty to attack and damage, or the difficulty to
	resist the Power, is reduced or increased by another point.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The Power cannot be resisted in the normal way when the
	juju focus is being used (eg., Karma Perception is no longer
	vulnerable to Empathic Resistance, Energy attacks ignore automatic
	soak successes or reduced soak difficulties due to Invulnerability
	or Energy Resistance).  Soak and Willpower checks are still allowed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The Power's concentration parameter is reduced by one
	level (High to Low, Low to None).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Active Powers may not be dampened or canceled (ie, are
	considered Passive) so long as the juju focus is in use when such
	a situation arises.  The focus does not restore such faculties if
	they have already be reduced.
	
	Sample Power Stunts
	¥¥¥¥ The Power Within:  The mutant must construct a new ju-ju focus
	(this cannot ever be added to an existing focus) to use this stunt. The
	mutant chooses a particular type of material to create the core or the
	majority of the focus.  Once created, any power channeled through that
	focus takes any properties of the material the mutant used (ie: a
	focus crafted out of silver would transfer the mystic properties of
	silver into any power channeled through it for an attack.  Werewolves
	would be unable to soak the damage from the mutant's attack.  There are
	other applications so let your imagination run wild).  The mutant elects
	to sacrifice any other bonuses the she may be entitled to from Ju-Ju
	Focus, whenever she uses this stunt.  She can use those bonuses with the 
	new focus if she does not use 'the power within'.

Jungian Shift (Physical/Social/Mental) [PL]
	The mutant's identity is tied up in her own perception of what the
	situation requires of her.  In a new situation, she manifests a
	new pseudo-identity that is better suited to dealing with it.  This
	is a sort of alter-ego, true, but the personality shift does not
	speak of multiple personalities, but rather many personality
	templates, which are called Archetypes.  These Archetypes always
	look like the 'base person' (if there could be such a thing) but
	may have different abilities, depending on the situation.  The
	implications of this are as follows:

	* For every Rank that the mutant has in this Power, she can have
	a new Archetype.  An Archetype is a role that the character falls
	into, like Warrior or Mother or Provider.  The 'base' personality
	is called the Uncarved.
	* Each Archetype may have a different configuration of Attributes
	(7/5/3) which are modified normally by improvements from Experience
	and Powers after they have been rearranged.  The mutant always looks
	about the same, even if you change his Appearance score.  Maybe
	it's just the way he carries himself that makes him so irresistible
	all of a sudden...
	* Each Archetype may have a different configuration of Abilities
	(13/9/5) which are modified normally by improvements from Experience
	and Powers after they have been rearranged.
	* A change in Archetype obviously denotes a change in personality;
	a Warrior is more confident and aggressive, perhaps with the Demeanor
	Bravo.  A Healer might have the Demeanor Caregiver.  It can be a
	subtle shift, but should be noticeable to those who know the mutant
	well.  A change in personality requires an action.

	¥ One Archetype
	¥¥ Two Archetypes
	¥¥¥ Three Archetypes
	¥¥¥¥ Four Archetypes
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Archetypes

Karma Channeling (Social) [AL]
	An unusual power, but one with a wide variety of applications.  The
	mutant reaches into the life of the people affected by her Power, 
	and they are punished or rewarded based on whether they have done
	good or evil.  The punishments and rewards vary, but prior to this
	determination there is one basic bifurcation in this Power- the
	mutant either reaches into her opinion of the victim, or the victim's
	own beliefs, to make the good/evil determination.  In any case,
	the degree of goodness or evil (and the Rank of the Power) will
	determine the 'level' of reaction- the Dhalai Lama might merit a
	Rank five good result, while a guy who is nice to his mom and
	doesn't litter would probably get a Rank one result regardless
	of the mutant's power.  Cable, if he did the Judgment Day variation
	of this Power, would certainly inflict a Rank five evil result on
	Apocalypse, but if he only had three Ranks in this Power then the
	third Rank reaction would be the best that he could muster.  The
	Trapster, by his lights, would probably suffer a Rank one evil
	result.  Dagger's Purifying Light weapons are a variation on the
	Force of Guilt.  A Perception + Karma Channeling roll (difficulty
	of the opposing character's Charisma + Empathy) is required to
	activate this Power.  Note that this Power can only be used once 
	per person per scene.

	Variation: Force of Guilt- the persons affected by this power define
	their own position on the axis of good and evil.  This is not a
	conscious decision, but rather a subconscious one.

	Variation: Judgment Day- the mutant makes her own decisions about 
	the relative position of the affected persons vis a vis good and
	evil.  If the mutant has been fed false info, this might lead to
	a curious encounter (Apocalypse is rewarded, for instance).  This
	is not a conscious decision, either.
	
	Variation: Oath Bonding- the mutant can oversee agreements between
	two or more parties (including himself, if desired), which will be
	enforced by the karmic forces, as per a reward or punishment below.
	The term of punishment will vary with the seriousness of the oath,
	but it can be as long as a year (for example, with the Health and
	Injury variant, the transgressor(s) might take damage every day
	until the term is over or the transgression is redressed).  One
	form of punishment is chosen at character creation; this variation
	does not dispense rewards.

	The mutant may also have either the full version of this power 
	(which can both reward and punish) or only a one-sided version 
	(which can either only reward- a test of worthiness- or only 
	punish).  A one-sided version is worth one Freebie point or 
	Experience point less per Rank.

	The nature of the reward and punishment varies widely:

	* Good and Ill Luck- a common variant.  The worthy get to re-roll
	one bad die per round per Rank of effect.  The unworthy must
	re-roll one success per round per Rank of effect.

	* Health and Injury- A weaker version of the Soulblazer variant 
	below, this variant causes one Health Level of damage to the 
	unworthy and heals one Health Level for the worthy.

	* Love and Hatred*- Requires that the victim be within range of 
	the mutant's voice.  The mutant praises or curses the victim, and 
	all people within range of the voice that do understand the 
	language will either see the victim as an ally or as an enemy, 
	depending on the worthiness or unworthiness of the victim.  True 
	Sight or Empathic Resistance will protect a person from seeing the 
	victim as the mutant intends.  This feeling will last until the 
	victim acts in a way that contradicts the characterization- it 
	could last years!  And it does not wear off for everyone when it 
	wears off for one observer.

	* The Penance Stare- Requires eye contact.  The channeler looks 
	the victim in the eye, and the victim suffers pain and anguish for all 
	of the evil that he has done.  This does not inflict any real damage, 
	but the victim will suffer from dice penalties.  The dice penalty 
	inflicted depends on how evil the victim is judged to be, but will be 
	a number between one and the mutant's Rank in this Power.  The effects 
	of the Stare last the normal amount of time (up to a day at Rank five) 
	for this Power.  Ghost Rider's version only punishes the evil.

	* Resolve and Despair- Quite simply, a person who is judged worthy has 
	her Willpower restored.  An unworthy person loses Willpower.

	* Righteous Wrath- This variant is frequently one-sided (affecting only 
	the worthy).  It grants the ability in the worthy to add their 
	Willpower to their damage pool against a particularly hated foe for 
	one round per Rank of effect.  This also costs a point of Willpower 
	per round.  These rounds do not have to be contiguous, but the ability 
	is lost at the end of the scene.  Against the unworthy, the mutant's 
	Willpower is subtracted from the victim's damage pool for one round 
	per Rank of effect.  This also costs a point of Willpower per round.

	* Soulblazer*- The most rare variation of Karma Channeling, this 
	Power releases either all of the positive or all of the negative 
	energy stored in the soul of the victim.  This energy either heals 
	the character- of one Health Level and point of Willpower per Rank 
	of effect- or harms the character for one Health Level per Rank of 
	effect.  The most potent fact about the soulfire that is released to 
	scourge the unworthy is that it cannot be healed until the character 
	makes amends for his misdeeds.  This damage overlays bashing, lethal, 
	AND aggravated damage.  The mutant cannot injure the victim with 
	this Power again until he has made amends.

	* Success and Failure*- those who are good get dice bonuses to one
	dice pool per round; those who are evil get dice penalties.

	* The Truth Revealed- this is usually the full-featured version of 
	Karma Channeling rather than a one-sided one.  Vaguely empathic, 
	this variation will cause the people looking on the victim of this 
	Power to see her in a new light- either as the holder of this Power 
	sees her, or as she sees herself.  The physical appearance of the 
	character will seem to change into an idealized version of the character.  
	For example, if Marrow had the Judgment Day version of this Power, 
	she would make Angel over into the most beautiful and divine creature 
	imaginable.  In any case, observers will get a vague sense of revulsion 
	or attraction to the character, which means that the character has 
	either increased or decreased difficulties for all social actions.  
	Note also that the mutant cannot use this Power on herself
	without the expenditure of a Willpower point- unless she buys it as a
	Power stunt.  The attraction/revulsion effects can be resisted with
	Empathic Resistance.

	¥ The karmic force can be directed at one creature at a time, for
	a period of one round (for damaging attacks) or as long as the mutant
	is willing to sustain concentration.  Three points or one die is the
	maximum amount that can be given, subtracted, or inflicted.
	¥¥ The force can affect only one creature for one round or as long as
	light concentration is held (the mutant can do lots of stuff, but not
	engage in combat).  Four points or dice are the maximum amount given,
	subtracted, or inflicted.
	¥¥¥ The force can affect yourself and one creature at the same time,
	for one scene (or one round if it is a damaging/healing result).  Up
	to five points or dice can be given, subtracted, or inflicted.
	¥¥¥¥ The force can affect all your enemies or all your friends at
	once, for one scene (or one round if it is a damaging/healing thing).
	Up to six points or dice can be given, subtracted, or inflicted.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The force can affect all your enemies and your friends at the
	same time, for one day (or one scene, round by round, if it is a
	damaging/healing thing).  Up to seven points or dice can be given,
	subtracted, or inflicted.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Mirrors- requires the Variation: The Truth Revealed.  Whenever
	the evil pass before a mirror, they see themselves as their karmic
	decider has judged them.  With the expenditure of a permanent
	Willpower point, this effect can be made permanent.
	¥¥ Stigmata- requires the Variation: Health and Injury.  The evil
	affected by this Power will receive some sort of symbolic injury or
	disfigurement, such as the mark of Cain.

Karma Perception (Social) [AN]
	All too often, a mutant runs into someone that he has never met
	before. Is this person good?  Evil?  Simply misguided?  This
	determination is just one of those that this Power can make.  The
	mutant is capable of seeing all of the good and all of the evil acts
	perpetrated by the people he touches, and weigh the balance between
	the two.  Most especially, the mutant may be able to see how the
	target has acted in similar situations in the past.  This Power is
	resisted by Resistance to Fate and Empathic Resistance, and will fail
	completely against mutants with these Powers.  No roll is required
	beyond the roll to hit, if necessary.  Under strange circumstances,
	the roll would be Perception + Karma Perception.  The mutant can view
	the target's 'moral aura' for the rest of the scene.
	
	Variation: Hellblazer*- this Power reveals the evil in everyone, unable
	to directly perceive the good alongside the evil.  The mutant may only
	judge good deeds and nature as anyone else might.  However, he gains
	one point of willpower per scene when directly opposing someone whom he
	believes to be truly evil.
	
	¥¥ The mutant can see the good and evil in a person at a touch.  This
	is an especially powerful way of seeing a person's past, as there are
	few ways of resisting it.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Domination Detection- if the target is being dominated or
	controlled in some direct way by another agency, the mutant will
	become aware of it if a Perception + Karma Channeling (diff 6) roll is
	successful.
	¥¥ Hamartia- if the target is in line for some hard times or
	punishment because of his behaviour, the mutant can see it with a
	Perception + Karma Perception roll (diff 8).
	¥¥ Incarnation Awareness- the mutant can see the target's most notable
	past lives, and their balance of good and evil, with a Manipulation +
	Karma Perception roll (difficulty 8).  The difficulty of this roll is
	reduced by one for every Rank the target has in Past Lives (minimum of
	2).
	¥¥ Moral Compass- the mutant can see the target's reaction to any
	particular event, and perceive the target's moral opinion of it.

Karma Use (Social) [AL]
	This is more of an 'emergency use' ability than anything else.  In
	a pinch, the mutant may substitute his current Experience score for
	any other dice pool (rolling Experience instead of Wits + Dodge to
	dive for cover, for instance), no matter how large the pool would
	be made thereby.  This Power is not without cost, however; if the
	mutant is substituting for a fully realized dice pool (i.e., he has
	both the Attribute and Ability in question, or he has at least one
	point in the Advantage), then it costs one Experience point to use.
	This is marked off after the roll is made.  If the mutant is using
	this Power to substitute for a dice pool that is not fully realized
	(for instance, using Experience in place of Int + Computers, when
	the mutant has no points in Computers, or using it in place of
	Willpower when the mutant has spent it all), then it costs two points
	of Experience.  This Power has no system of itself.
	
	¥ In an emergency, the mutant may call upon his Karma to save his
	life.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Banking on it- at any time the mutant does a good deed for someone
	(and that person is grateful), he may spend one Experience point to 
	turn the person into a Contact.  Two Experience makes the individual
	an Ally.

Kinetic Dampening Field (Social) [AL]
	This Power causes the mutant to radiate a field in which
	high-intensity kinetic energy is dampened to lower levels.  It
	operates in much the same respect as Power Dampening, subtracting
	effective Ranks from any force that exists in its bounds, to a minimum
	level of zero Ranks (not enough to damage anyone or have any secondary
	effects).  It will not just dampen kinetic energy bolts created by
	mutants; it will also dampen any sort of high-intensity kinetic
	energy, including physical attacks, passing trucks, etc.  This Power
	requires light concentration to activate and maintain- roll Charisma +
	KDF (diff 6) to establish it.  Note that this Power dampens the
	mutant's own movements!

	¥ The range of the dampening effect is ten feet.  All energy in its
	range is dampened by one effective Rank (NOT one Health Level!).
	All physical attacks lose two dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥ The range is fifteen feet.  Energy is dampened by two effective
	Ranks.  All physical attacks lose four dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥¥ The range is twenty feet.  Energy is dampened by three effective
	Ranks.  All physical attacks lose six dice from their damage pools.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is twenty-five feet.  Energy is dampened by four
	effective Ranks.  All physical attacks lose eight dice from their
	damage pools.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range is thirty feet.  Energy is dampened by five effective
	Ranks.  All physical attacks lose ten dice from their damage pools.

Kinetic Force Control (Social) [AL]
	The control of kinetic force is related to Telekinesis, but it cannot
	create new force; only redirect, amplify, or dampen existing force.
	In this way, the mutant can make his own punches more powerful, and
	take the sting out of the blows of his enemies.  A Manipulation +
	Kinetic Force Control roll (difficulty 4 for his own force, 6 for
	forces originating with others) is the normal system used with this
	Power.  One success per 50 kilograms of mass is generally required.

	* Note- this Power is, for all intents and purposes, identical to
	the Power: Energy Control (Kinetic Force) but it deserved some
	explication.

	¥ The mutant can redirect the movement of his own body- allowing
	him to suddenly change targets, or even fly if enough force is
	involved.  After the first round, this redirection can be maintained
	unless contested with light concentration.
	¥¥ The mutant can amplify or deaden the movement of his own body-
	slowing falls, increasing the damage from his punches, etc.
	Each success beyond the minimum increases or decreases the damage
	pool of the mutant's attacks by one, or increases/decreases his
	speed by 10 mph.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can redirect the movement of the bodies of others.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can amplify or deaden the movement of the bodies
	of others.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can redirect or amplify the force of the molecular 
	movement of fluids (liquids and gasses).

Knell Sounding (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	A knell is the peal of a bell that announces death.  This Power is only
	used at that time- when it would seem that your mutant is about to die.
	When the character takes a wound that would have killed him (he fails
	his soak roll, etc.) he will live just long enough to speak the name of
	a person within the range of his voice. They must both make Stamina
	checks (diff 6) at that point-- the mutant's check does not count dice
	penalties, though his target does not share this advantage.  The person
	who makes fewer successes takes the damage.  If the other person (we
	will call him the 'hapless victim') is the recipient of this damage, he
	is able to make a soak roll if the damage is of a sort that he can
	soak.  If the mutant is the recipient of this damage, then he is dead-
	having already attempted the soak roll.  Note that any amount of damage
	that the mutant has soaked from this lethal attack is deducted from the
	amount that the hapless victim must soak.

	¥¥¥ The mutant, so long as he can draw breath, may be able
	to inflict his death on others.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Link Passing- if the mutant has a Psychic Link, Health Proxy, is
	an Avatar, or has some other link to a person or persons, he may use
	that link to choose a victim, which does not require that the target
	be within audible range.

Life Force Absorption and Conversion (Social) [AL]
	This power is similar to Life Force Vampirism, but it does not come
	with the benefits or the flaw attached to it.  Trevor Fitzroy has
	this power- he absorbs the life-force of humans in order to activate
	his time-travel abilities.  In the same way, raw life force can be
	absorbed by any mutant with this Power and employed in a variety
	of ways.  This damage is aggravated, and is difficulty 8 to soak.
	The mutant must touch his victims to drain Life Force (Dex + Brawl).

	Common Variations:
	* Age Regression- the mutant de-ages one year for every Health Level
	she absorbs.  She can choose to harmlessly dissipate the Life Force
	instead.
	* Hedge Magic- the mutant requires enough Life Force to power any
	ritual that he happens to know- two Health Levels for each Rank of the
	ritual.
	* Physical Transformation- a change of state occurs when the mutant has
	absorbed enough Life Force- he takes on the form of a physical alter
	ego, commonly monstrous.  This is a pre-set form, which costs two
	Health Levels to shift into per point of Strength, Dexterity, and
	Stamina that the form has in excess of his normal levels, and three
	Health Levels per extra level of Health that he receives in this form. 
	This power does not work when in the altered state, which lasts until
	the mutant decides to return to his normal form.
	* Power*- the mutant absorbs the Powers of the victim.  Only one person
	can be mimicked in this way at a time.  No Power Stunts are stolen.
	These powers last one day per three Health Levels.  This variation
	costs double.  Note that the mutant can not absorb Powers which exceed
	his Actual Power Level in Rank.
	* Teleportation- the mutant can absorb Health Levels in order to power
	this ability, the activation of which takes one round.  For every two
	levels absorbed, the mutant may simulate one Rank of the Teleportation
	power (up to the rank of this Power).
	* Time Travel- requires a full ten Health Levels per year (or fraction
	thereof) that the mutant wants to move through.  A long trip will
	require a protracted killing spree...
	* Umbral Shift- with the absorption of enough Life Force, the mutant
	can step sideways.  One Health Level per point of the Gauntlet is
	required.  Of course, getting back may be a problem unless you store
	some...

	¥ The mutant can drain one Health Level per attack.
	¥¥ The mutant can drain two Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Three Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- your mutant can store an amount of energy in Health
	Levels equal to his Power Rank.  These levels dissipate at the rate
	of one per day, until they vanish... use them quickly.

Life Force Manipulation (Social) [AH]
	The Pattern that makes up all sentient life forms is complex and most
	mysterious, but a mutant with this Power understands it intuitively.  A
	Manipulation + LFM roll (difficulty 10 - the current score for the
	advantage being altered) is required.  Typically, when the mutant wants
	to affect a subject, physical contact is required.  Characters who have
	an Immutable Pattern are immune to all effects of this Power.
	
	¥ Convert two points of an expendable advantage (Willpower, Power
	Charge, Gnosis, or Rage) into one point of another such advantage.
	This affects the mutant only.
	¥¥ Other mutants may be affected with this Power, at the same rate.
	This requires that the mutant touch his subject (Dex + Brawl, etc. if
	necessary).  The mutant may not transfer power from one being to
	another.
	¥¥¥ Health Levels can also be converted, at the same rate.  Other
	beings (humans, werewolves, changelings, etc.) can be affected, though
	only living beings can be so altered.  Vampires and wraiths are quite
	immune.  The mutant's own last Health Level can be spent in this way,
	but not that of other people.
	¥¥¥¥ More esoteric advantages, such as Quintessence, Sanity, Qi, or
	even Blood Pool can be converted, so long as it is a living being
	who is being manipulated.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The conversion rate is one to one.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Attributes may be scrambled (the mutant may adjust Strength,
	Intelligence, Manipulation, etc. by moving points around).  Attributes
	that are being bolstered by a Mega-Attribute can not be affected in
	this way.

Life Force Vampirism (Social) [PL]
	This power will not make your mutant very popular, but at least it
	will make him formidable.  Omega Red has this ability, which obviates
	the need for food but requires the mutant to drain the life forces
	of others to sustain himself.  In game terms, the mutant loses one
	Health Level per day unless he is nourished with at least three
	Health Levels drained by this power.  This power is activated on
	touch, and for every three Health Levels drained from a victim, the
	mutant heals one Health Level.  Don't expect to be invited to too
	many parties, though.  Surplus Health can be absorbed via this power,
	but it is lost unless the mutant has the Store Energy Power Stunt.
	This damage is most certainly aggravated, and is difficulty 8 to soak.

	¥ The mutant can drain one Health Level per attack.
	¥¥ The mutant can drain two Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Three Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- your mutant can store an amount of energy in Health
	Levels equal to his Power Rank.  These levels can be used to heal
	himself at any time, or can be saved to keep himself nourished.
	Three Health Levels must be absorbed to bank one level.
	¥¥ Dormant*- this Power Stunt costs five Willpower just to develop,
	and five to cement.  When the mutant falls to zero Health levels as
	a result of the drain associated with this power, he stays in a
	state of sleep until he is touched, which automatically activates
	an attack by this power.

Life Gestalt (Physical/Social) [AN]
	An unusual Power that must be taken by at least two people if it is to
	function, since it operates as a sort of "life-line" between them.
	Basically, the two mutants share Health Levels.  Each mutant, therefore,
	has two Bruised Levels, two Wounded Levels, etc.  Thus, when one of the
	mutants is in danger, it is twice as difficult to kill him.  However, when
	the last Health Level is gone, both people die.  Dice penalties are shared
	between the various parties- when they are down to Crippled, both people
	suffer a -5 dice penalty.  Of course, if both people are in danger, then
	this Power does not yield much advantage- unless there is a third member
	in the Gestalt... No roll is required.

	¥¥ Two people have linked Health in a Life Gestalt.
	¥¥¥ Three people
	¥¥¥¥ Four people
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five people

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Pain distribution- the people in the Gestalt can choose to take the
	pain that one of the others is feeling and distribute it among
	themselves. Thus, if the mutants is reduced to Crippled, they all have
	-5 dice penalties.  However, one of the other people in a link can
	choose to take on all five of the penalty dice (all of the pain) from
	his partner (taking him to -10, full Incapacity) or a few of them. 
	Several people in the link can split the penalties from one person. 
	If a mutant takes on more foreign dice penalties in this way than he
	has Stamina, he must make a Willpower check, diff 8, or lose
	consciousness.
	¥¥¥¥ Stamina Gestalt- the mutant soaks damage with the highest Stamina
	score in the Gestalt.

Life Support (Physical) [PN]
	The mutant does not have the same sorts of needs for survival that
	most other people do if he has this power.  At extreme levels, he can
	survive the rigours of outer space or the Antarctic comfortably.
	Colossus and Iceman have this power when they are in their altered
	forms.  Chamber and Omega Red have it all the time.  No roll is
	required.

	Special Flaw: Dependent State (2 pts)- the mutant's Life Support only
	functions when he is in a special state of body or consciousness, as
	with Colossus and Iceman (who must be utilizing Matter Body).
	
	¥ The mutant does not need to sleep.
	¥¥ The mutant does not need to eat.  The energy is received from the
	sun, or some other source.
	¥¥¥ The mutant does not need to breathe.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant is not harmed by natural extremes of temperature
	(-50¡C to 50¡C) and has two automatic soak vs. hot or cold.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant is not harmed by radiation, and can exist in a vacuum
	with no ill effects.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant is immune to viral and bacterial diseases, no matter
	how deadly.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant's body does not deteriorate with age; he is
	effectively ageless.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant can be resuscitated after any period of time if he
	has been killed, so long as the damage to his body is sufficiently
	repaired.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Lethal damage is insufficient to kill the mutant.  Damage
	must be aggravated before death occurs.  The mutant may be chopped,
	diced, even pureed, but he will continue to live until he takes enough
	aggravated damage.  Note that if the mutant's body is too badly
	damaged, then normal healing will not occur (even though he is still
	very much alive).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's life force is instilled even in the atoms that
	make up his body.  He is virtually unkillable.  You can sure put a
	hurtin' on him, though...

Linguistic Mastery (Mental) [PN]
	A more prosaic vision of Cyphering (q.v.), this Power allows mutants to
	learn languages easily.  A variety of special effects are possible for
	a mutant who has mastered the arts of communication.  There is no
	special system for this Power; use the Linguistics knowledge as normal
	with the following modifications:

	¥ This level of Linguistic Mastery adds up to three Ranks in the
	Linguistics Knowledge, to a maximum of six dots.  This Power also adds
	its Rank to the current score in Linguistics to determine how many
	languages the mutant is actually eligible to know.
	¥¥ Rank seven max.  At this Rank, the mutant adds one auto-success to
	all Expression, Performance, Diplomacy, or Subterfuge rolls in
	situations where the mutant is using language as his medium.
	¥¥¥ Eight.  Additionally, the mutant adds one auto-success to all Sense
	Deception, Intimidation, Politics, Ettiquette, and Research rolls in
	which language is the medium.
	¥¥¥¥ Nine.  Two automatic successes are garnered in all the abilities
	above plus Enigmas rolls, where appropriate.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten.  The mutant automatically detects Persuasion.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Accent Supremacy- having met persons of differing accents for particular
	languages, the mutant can perfectly mimic these accents (i.e., a hero
	speaking English might be able to mimic the South Islanders, Cockneys,
	Newfoundlanders, New Englanders, or even make a distinct Parisian English
	vs. Cologne English accent without flaw).
	¥ Like a Machine- all difficulties for Research rolls are reduced by one.
	¥¥ Like a Baby- the mutant may learn a new language to full fluency after
	only one week's immersion.
	¥¥ Structure- one success on rolls to understand a person speaking a
	foreign language is considered to be worth five successes-- i.e., the
	mutant understands a sentence with one success, rather than a word.
	¥¥¥ Undercover- the mutant intuitively tailors his vocabulary and accent to
	foster favourable reactions on any roll for Investigation or Carousing,
	gaining auto-successes as appropriate for the Rank in this Power.  Acting
	and Disguise rolls are reduced in difficulty by one when oration is
	necessary.

Liquification (Social) [AL]
	The Melter was possessed of the Power to liquefy solid matter, but
	that is not the only form that this Power can take.  In any case,
	the process of liquification does not entail any change in heat,
	but merely alters the behavior of the individual molecules in a
	substance so that it acts like a liquid.  Although the temperature
	and mass do not change, the volume of the substance (and thus, its
	density) may change.  This Power does not normally affect living
	matter, including material like Colossus' 'organic steel'.
	This Power requires a Charisma + Liquification roll, with a
	difficulty dependent on the solidity or rarification of the
	matter in question.

	Variant: Solid Liquification- the mutant can change non-living
	solids into liquids.

	Variant: Gas Liquification- the mutant can change non-living gasses
	(OK, so there aren't many gaseous life forms, but the rule still
	applies) into liquids.

	Variant: Living Matter Liquification*- the mutant can either take
	the Solid or Gas Variant of this Power.  For double cost, the 
	mutant can also liquefy living matter, which delivers Rank damage
	to its victims (aggravated) and dissolves one point of Stamina
	from the hapless victim if he fails to soak all of this damage.

	¥ Solids as dense as clay and as hard as plastic can be dissolved.  A
	gas as rarefied as oxygen can be liquefied.  Up to 2 kg of substances
	meeting these criteria can be affected in a round.
	¥¥ Solids as dense as soapstone and as hard as pine can be dissolved.

Luck/Probability Manipulation (Social) [AL]
	Longshot and Domino rarely find themselves in a mess that they cannot
	extract themselves from, because they are smiled upon by the gods.
	Whether coincidence aids them in bizarre ways, or they rarely seem
	to fail at whatever they attempt, mutants with this power are a sort
	of maverick force- expect almost anything.  No roll is required to
	activate this Power.

	Special Flaw: Pure Heart (2 or 4 point Flaw) Longshot has this Flaw,
	which limits his ability to alter probability.  His motives must be
	pure when he decides to go for the long shot, or his power fails him.
	For four points, bad luck occurs when the mutant's intentions are
	not just (see the Hex Power for examples of bad luck).

	Some Days the Bear Gets You (4 point flaw): Lady Luck is a fickle
	mistress, and doesn't tend to appreciate being manipulated. A mutant
	who suffers from this flaw is possessed of the same uncanny good
	fortune as Domino or Longshot, but will find that fate is entirely
	willing to bite the hand that feeds. Any time the mutant uses
	Luck/Probability Manipulation to re-reoll a check and fails the redone
	roll (or in the case of assisting an ally the ally fails the roll; or
	when attempting to hinder an enemy if the enemy succeeds despite the
	interference) the mutant's Power will desert him during the next scene
	he attempts to use it; it is important to note that any remaining uses
	in the current scene are still available, as the Lady is perfectly
	willing to let her victims sweat before calling the debt due. Even more
	dangerous is if the mutant should botch a re-done roll (or if an enemy
	should roll a number of 10s equal to at least half the dice the mutant
	attempted to influence). If this should happen the mutant will be hexed
	(as per the Power) with a rank effect equal to the number of 1s rolled.
	
	¥ One roll per scene can be redone (if it is the mutant's action).
	One die per scene can be rerolled (per opponent or ally).
	¥¥ Two rolls per scene can be redone (if it is the mutant's action).
	Two dice per scene can be redone (per opponent or ally).
	¥¥¥ Three rolls per scene plus one die per roll can be redone (mutant).
	Three dice per scene can be redone (other).
	¥¥¥¥ Four rolls per scene plus one die per roll can be redone (mutant).
	One roll per scene can be redone (other).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five rolls per scene plus two dice per roll (mutant).  Two
	rolls per scene plus two dice per scene can be redone (other).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Force Reroll- the mutant can spend a point of Willpower in order
	to force any die on the table to be rerolled.
	¥¥¥ Coincidence- a strange coincidence can occur to bail the mutant
	out of a big jam.  Spend two Willpower.  (ST's discretion on what
	form this coincidence takes)
	¥¥¥ Devil's Own- the mutant has a 'luck sense' that works something
	like intuition and something like danger sense.  Before she walks
	into a bad situation, or meets someone that might be important to her,
	she may have a sense that something important is about to happen.
	This is a Perception + Luck (rolled by the ST).
	¥¥¥ Keep the Baby- when the mutant elects to redo a roll for himself,
	he may keep one die (or two dice at Rank five).

Machine Possession (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	A curious variation on Technological Telepathy and Physical 
	Possession, this Power (which was possessed by the original Box of
	Alpha Flight) allows a mutant to 'climb in' a machine using a
	sort of tactile mass-shifting ability and then take over its
	functions, using the machine as his own body.  If the machine is
	capable of moving (a car can move, a robot can move, a television
	cannot), then the mutant can move as if the machine was his own
	body.  He has Stamina and Health Levels appropriate to his new
	'body', and the appropriate immunities to such trivia as gasses,
	poisons, etc.  The mutant does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep
	while possessing the machine (as Life Support ¥¥¥) though he will
	find these needs dog him normally when he is not possessing a
	machine.  Unless the machine is sentient, it receives no roll to
	resist this possession; otherwise, a resisted Willpower roll can
	be made (diff 7 for both parties)- the winner controls the body.
	If the mutant is the loser in such a contest, he is ejected.
	If any roll other than this contested Willpower check is required,
	it will be a Stamina check.

	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can take over machines and use them as if they
	were his own body.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ CSP- his stunt enables the mutant to use an Altered Perceptions
	(Mental) power while in possession of a machine.

Magic Absorption/Conversion (Social/Mental) [AL]
	Magical effects tend to fail around a mutant with this Power, as he
	harnesses the energies that fuel them.  This is effective against True
	Magick as well as Hedge Magick. The mutant must concentrate to disrupt
	a magickal effect, which is a Manipulation + Magic Absorption/
	Conversion roll (diff 6).  The number of successes required on the roll
	is equal to the Rank of the effect being cast- so against a Ball of
	Abysmal Flame, (Prime ¥¥¥¥), four successes would be required. If the
	magician is using some sort of device (like a Fetish or focus) to
	perform or even assist in the effect, the difficulty increases to
	eight. These effects do not have to target the mutant, but must either
	be triggered within ten feet of him or originate within ten feet.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Quintessence- the mutant can release the magical energy in a special
	attack, as if he had the Power: Energy Emission (Quintessence).  It is
	difficulty 8 to soak and unravels any enchantments that it strikes. 
	The damage pool for this power is equal to the amount of Ranks absorbed
	times 2.
	* Probability Flux- for every Rank that the mutant absorbs, he can
	direct one die to be rerolled on any die roll in that scene.
	* Mirror- the mutant gains the ability to cast the effect that was just
	absorbed.  He may do this once, and must do it immediately or the
	energy is lost.
	* Geomancy- the mutant can summon blasts of earth energy from beneath
	the feet of a foe using the energy he absorbs.  This is a physical/
	magical attack that inflicts two Health Levels of damage for each rank
	absorbed.
	* Spells- the mutant may decrease the difficulty of his Hedge Magick or
	Hex Power by one when he absorbs a point of quintessence.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant can absorb and convert magical attacks.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Energy- the mutant may store magical energy (like a mage can)
	for more than one round or scene.  The amount of this energy that can
	be stored is equal to the mutant's Stamina + Magic A/C.


Magic Backlash (Social/Mental) [AN]
	The mutant who has this Power is a bane to mages of all stripes.
	Any True magick performed in the presence of someone who has the
	Magic Backlash Power is treated as Vulgar, with witnesses, and
	furthermore attracts one point of Paradox to the mage per Rank
	in this Power on top of its normal allotment.  The magickal
	effect still works, it's just that the mage probably won't be
	performing too many of them, at this rate.  No roll is required.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Trace Source- the mutant can, with a Perception + Magic
	Backlash roll, determine where a particular magickal effect came
	from.
	¥¥¥¥ Backlash- if a magician accumulates more Paradox than she
	has Arte, the mutant may trigger a paradox backlash with a
	Charisma + Magic Backlash roll (diff of the magician's Willpower).
	¥¥¥¥ Hedging the Truth- any Hedge Magick or magical Powers used
	in the presence of the mutant attracts Paradox as if it were
	True Magick.

Magic Resistance (Social/Mental) [PN]
	With this Power, the mutant can become a hunter of mages, and can
	consort with them with little fear.  Magic seems to fail when used
	directly against the mutant, whether its intent is helpful or
	harmful.  He gets a countermagick dice pool which the player rolls
	every time magick is employed with the mutant as its target.  Each
	countermagick success negates a magick success, and may well cause
	the spell to fail.

	¥ The mutant gets three dice of countermagick
	¥¥ Four dice of countermagick
	¥¥¥ Five dice of countermagick
	¥¥¥¥ Six dice of countermagick
	¥¥¥¥¥ Seven dice of countermagick

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Detect magick- the mutant has learned how to tell when magick is
	employed against her (even though her power is involuntary) by the
	feel of it.  This is a Perception + Awareness roll.
	¥ Lower defenses- the mutant may 'shut off' her defenses against
	magick, though they are automatically restored if she loses
	consciousness.
	¥¥ Awareness- the mutant may purchase the Awareness Talent.

Maniacal Laughter (Social/Mental) [AL]
	Like the fourth Green Goblin, a mutant with this Power has a laugh that
	is... disturbing.  This laughter usually sounds like the ravings of a
	lunatic being tickled with a chainsaw- or something like that.  In any
	case, the sound of the laughter carries an empathic effect that will
	take hold of those who can hear it.  This costs a point of Willpower.
	This Power is Empathic, and as such can be resisted by mutants with
	the Empathic Resistance Power.

	Variation: Brain-Scrambling Laugh- the laughter makes it difficult
	to concentrate, adding 1 to the difficulty of all actions and 2 to
	the difficulty of all actions that require concentration, including
	Telepathy.  This effect lasts the rest of the scene.

	Variation: Chilling Laugh- the laughter causes fear as the Power:
	Horror Factor.  Use the resistance rolls for that Power instead
	of the ones listed here.  The effect lasts until the end of the
	scene, or when the victim has moved out of earshot for four 
	consecutive rounds.

	Variation: Discordian Laugh*- the laughter causes temporary madness, 
	giving those who hear it a random Derangement for as long as the
	mutant keeps laughing plus ten days less the victim's Willpower score.

	Variation: Derisive Laugh*- the laughter causes feelings of weakness
	and helplessness, subtracting one die per Rank from all dice pools
	and reversing the Power: Confidence Boost.  The effect lasts for as
	long as the mutant keeps laughing plus one round per Rank.

	¥ Victims roll Willpower to resist (diff 6).  One success is required.
	¥¥ The resistance roll is difficulty 6, but two successes are required.
	¥¥¥ Difficulty 7, two successes required.
	¥¥¥¥ Diff 7, three successes required.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Diff 8, three successes required.

Martial Arts Supremacy (Physical) [PN]
	Iron Fist has this Power, which makes the mutant into one of the
	greatest hand-to-hand combat technicians alive.  It allows the mutant
	to use Martial Arts (a Skill, rather than the Brawl score, which is
	a Talent) and then add his Rank in this Power to all rolls associated
	with Martial Arts, including rolls to hit or block and damage pools.
	No roll is required.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Kata- the mutant may train with one melee weapon, such as a sword
	or mace, and use his score in Martial Arts rather than his score in
	Melee to attack with it.  As such, the bonuses from this Power are
	applied to it.
	¥ Meditative Focus- the mutant may purchase the Power: Meditative
	Focus with Experience.
	¥ Size Up- The character makes a Perception / Martial Arts Mastery roll
	at diff 7.  Success reveals the opponent's rank in Melee, Brawl, or
	Martial Arts, whichever is most applicable.  This is meant to represent
	a Martial Arts Master's ability to gauge an opponent's strength from
	their attitude and posture.
	¥¥ Kata- a second such weapon may be learned.
	¥¥ Yadomejutsu- the mutant is eligible to learn the ancient art of
	arrow and knife deflection (a Talent)- Yado requires the mutant to
	match his opponent's successes to hit, except at diff 7.  If he
	succeeds, he takes no damage.  He may attempt to catch these missiles;
	this is a diff 8 trick.
	¥¥¥ Kata- a third weapon may be learned.
	¥¥¥ Lung-Gom- through breathing exercises, the mutant may reduce his
	weight by half; this will decrease the difficulty of all leaping,
	climbing, acrobatics, balance, etc. rolls by two.  It also reduces
	the mutant's difficulty to soak damage from a fall by two.  The mutant
	must declare that he is starting lung-gom exercises, but it does not
	take an action to do so.
	¥¥¥ Takedown- Rather than directly dealing damage, a mutant may use his
	enemy's own force against him for takedowns, holds, throws, pins etc.
	This stunt allows the mutant to use his total damage pool rather than
	Strength for the purposes of contested Strength rolls, when employing
	these sorts of maneuvers.
	¥¥¥¥ Hyper-Leaping- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hyper-Leaping
	with Experience.  Requires the Stunt: Lung-Gom.
	¥¥¥¥ Kata- a fourth weapon may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Kata- a fifth weapon may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Quivering Palm- this legendary martial arts technique allows
	the mutant to deliver his Rank in damage to any solid merely by
	laying his hand upon it.  This damage is inflicted each round until
	contact is broken.  Stone, glass, and crystals are particularly
	susceptible to this assault.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Dim Mak- the mutant has such control over his internal
	energy (chi) that he can touch or strike an opponent and delay the
	onset of damage for any period that he desires.  This interval must be
	chosen at the time of the strike.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Kata- a sixth weapon may be learned.

Masquing* (Physical) [AL]
	This Power, possessed by the diabolical Masque of the Morlocks, is
	the ability to change the physical attributes of others- to make
	them over into new people in the same way that Masque did to Callisto.
	As a force for good, this Power is potent.  As a force for evil, it
	is just plain frightening.  The mutant typically rolls Stamina +
	Masquing to begin the process of changing a person's physical
	attributes (including Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, and Appearance)
	and then touches the recipient of her attentions.  A low-level
	adhesion ability kicks in, making the victim's flesh sticky and
	malleable in the mutant's hands.  Dexterity + Fine Control rolls
	are made in order to actually change the person's body.  Note
	that grappling a victim into immobility (Dexterity + Brawl,
	diff 7, three successes to establish hold, then accumulate
	successes on a Strength + Brawl roll equal to or greater than the
	victim's Strength each round- diff 6) may be required in a combat
	situation.

	Note that attributes can be reduced to 1 or raised to 5 in the
	normal vein.  If the victim can increase a certain attribute above
	5 with Experience, then the Masquer can also increase it above
	5, to a maximum of the recipient's Power Potential.  All changes
	made using this Power are permanent.

	¥ The mutant can increase or decrease a character's Strength,
	Dexterity, Stamina, or Appearance by one point.
	¥¥ The physical stats can be changed by up to two points.
	¥¥¥ Three points.
	¥¥¥¥ Four points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Skew- the mutant can skew a person's flesh with a Dexterity +
	Masquing Roll (diff 7), inflicting one Health Level of damage.
	¥¥ Rend- the mutant can attempt to tear a character's flesh
	from her bones with a successful Dexterity + Masquing roll (diff 8)
	if three successes are scored.  This inflicts four dice of damage.
	¥¥¥ Soften Bones- by spending a point of Willpower, the mutant
	can temporarily soften a victim's bones, increasing the difficulty
	to soak any blunt force attack by two.  This requires a successful
	grapple (three successes on Dex + Brawl).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Enervate*- the mutant can permanently remove a Health Level
	from a victim by scoring three successes on a Dexterity +
	Masquing (diff 9).

Mass-Shifting (Physical/Social - see below) [AL]
	The ability to change the density of your body is one that must be used
	carefully, but a mutant who has this power (Shadowcat and the Blob each
	have a variation) can become a force to be reckoned with in combat
	situations.  The mutant either picks the ability to increase her mass
	below normal levels, or increase it to abnormal levels.  The ability to
	do both requires a dual purchase (Mass-Shifting [Increase] and
	Mass-Shifting [Decrease] will have separate Power entries and Power
	Ranks on your character sheet).  This power requires a successful
	Stamina check (difficulty of 3 + the Rank effect) to activate.

	* Increase Mass (Physical)

	Variation: Dense Flesh- rather than having the ability to increase his
	mass, the mutant (like Puck) merely has incredibly dense flesh.
	Purchase this Power (Mass-Shifting [Increase]) as normal, but take the
	physical modifications as permanent.  Many Stunts (such as Aggressive
	Mass-shifting) are not possible for a character with Dense Flesh.

	¥ Mutant gains one Strength and Stamina point and a Health level
	¥¥ Mutant gains two Strength and Stamina points, and 2 Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Mutant gains three Strength and Stamina points, and 3 Health Levels.
	He loses one point of Dexterity.
	¥¥¥¥ Mutant gains four Strength and Stamina points, and 4 Health Levels.
	He loses one point of Dexterity.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant gains five Strength and Stamina points, and 5 Health Levels.
	He loses two points of Dexterity.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Mutant gains six Strength, Stamina, Health Levels, and an automatic
	soak success.  He loses two points of Dexterity.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Mutant gains seven Strength, Stamina and Health Levels, and two
	automatic soak successes.  He loses two points of Dex.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Mutant gains eight Strength, Stamina, and Health Levels, and
	three automatic soak successes.  He loses three points of Dex.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Mutant gains nine Strength, Stamina and Health, and four auto
	soak.  He loses three points of Dex.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Mutant gains ten Strength, Stamina, and Health, and five
	auto soak.  He loses three points of Dex.

	Note that these are the maximum increases- a mutant with level 3 Mass
	Shifting [Increase] might choose to increase his density to Rank two
	levels.  Each Rank increase represents doubled mass, so a 100 kg.
	mutant with Mass Shifting [Increase] ¥¥¥¥¥ could increase his mass to
	3,200 kg.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Hardened- the mutant's increased density also represents harder skin
	or flesh.  Compare to the equivalent level of Matter Hardening (note
	that the mutant does NOT get the extra effects described in that
	Power).  This may prevent enemies using certain weapons from being able
	to penetrate the mutant's skin.
	¥¥¥ Aggressive Mass-shifting- the mutant can Mass-shift other people
	and objects, so long as he is touching them.
	¥¥¥¥ Blunt the Cutting Edge- a mutant with this Power Stunt gets his
	Rank in automatic soak versus slashing weapons.
	¥¥¥¥ Immovability- A mutant with Immovability can plant his feet and
	stay put.  A Strength roll (difficulty 9) with a number of successes
	equal to the mutant's Strength is required to make him move.

	* Decrease Mass [Intangibility] (Physical/Social)

	¥ The mutant loses a point of Strength, but gains one automatic
	success in Athletics rolls for purposes such as jumping, climbing, and
	running.  She gains one extra die for initiative and dodging. Her
	maximum jumping height and distance is increased by fifty percent. She
	has one extra die to soak falling damage.
	¥¥ The mutant loses two points of Strength, but gains two automatic
	successes in Athletics as above, and two dice for initiative and
	dodging.  Her maximum jumping height and distance is doubled. She has
	two extra dice to soak falling damage.
	¥¥¥ The mutant loses three points of Strength, but gains three
	automatic successes in Athletics as above, and three dice for
	initiative and dodging.  Her maximum jumping height and distance is
	quadrupled, and she has four extra dice to soak falling damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Intangibility- the mutant can lower her mass to the point of
	intangibility (zero Strength in this form- cannot manipulate objects)
	but she is not affected by Physical attacks or most Energy attacks.
	She can walk through walls, people, etc.  Unfortunately, she cannot
	breathe at this point, so unless she has life support of some kind,
	she will have to solidify to 'come up for air' at some point.  To
	activate intangibility requires a Stamina check (diff 6) until the ST
	rules that the mutant is used to this intangibility effect.  Each new
	use of this Rank of Mass Shifting (stunts, etc.) requires a Stamina
	check.  
	
	Note: Rank four is the maximum Rank of the Physical version of this
	Power.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ Phase Shift- the mutant can take herself completely 'out of
	phase' with the physical, making herself invisible as well as
	intangible.  At this Rank, she is immune to all energy Powers, etc. but
	she is effectively blind unless she has a special Power that will
	compensate for this change (such as Dimension Shifting, certain paths
	of Hedge Magick, high Ranks of Clairvoyance, etc.)  As there is no air
	out of phase, the Breathe stunt will avail the mutant nothing here;
	without Life Support, she'll be done for in short order.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Quantum Shift- the mutant can take herself right out of the
	continuum, which is even more far-reaching than a mere phase shift.
	Removed from the bounds of probability and even time, she will be
	immediately forgotten, even erased from history, as soon as she
	executes a quantum shift.  Only when she realigns herself will she
	return to reality.  While she is in a state of Quantum Shift, her
	protection from reality grants her the equivalent of Life Support 
	at Rank seven.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Aggressive Mass-shifting- the mutant can mass-shift other people
	or objects, so long as she is touching them.  This is a Manipulation +
	Mass Shifting roll (difficulty of the object's total Health Levels).
	¥¥¥ Differential Density- this highly useful Stunt allows the mutant
	to make different parts of her body have different densities.  This
	takes some concentration (+1 difficulty to all rolls for as long as it
	is kept up) but can allow such tricks as phasing out to intangibility
	except for the fists, which can punch an opponent.
	¥¥¥¥ Breathe- requires the Stunt: Aggressive Mass Shifting.  When she
	is intangible, a mutant cannot breathe.  This Stunt allows a mutant to
	continually mass-shift everything that comes into contact with a given
	surface of her body- say, her nose- to be shifted down to the same
	mass- the same phase- as she is at.  This would allow her to breathe. 
	Of course, the Stunt does not differentiate between different types of
	matter, so if someone tried to punch her in the nose, they could be
	shifted down to her density as well.
	¥¥¥¥ Disrupt Machinery- the mutant's E-M field is not dispersed by
	intangibility, and it can bugger delicate circuits if the mutant
	passes through the machine.  Delivers up to 4 Health levels of damage.
	The mutant may have to roll a Dex + Brawl to activate this Power.
	¥¥¥¥ Perfect Alignment- requires the Stunt: Disrupt Machinery.  A very
	tricky business, this Stunt requires that the mutant 'phase' into
	another person of about the same size.  She must maneuver delicately
	(Dexterity + Medicine, diff 9) and on three successes, she is
	more-or-less aligned with the 'host' with regard to their nervous
	system.  Since her own E-M emissions are still normal, the mutant can
	attempt to fire the host's nerves in a specific pattern to get her to
	make some movement- simply by moving in that way herself!  Her own
	electrical nerve impulses will echo up the host's nerves and trigger
	the brain response desired with any luck.  Each movement is a
	Dexterity + Medicine roll (difficulty 9), requiring at least two
	successes.
	¥¥¥¥ Slingshot- Kitty Pryde demonstrated this stunt, which allows the
	mutant to dissociate herself from the earth's rotation and travel at
	high speeds.  Be careful with this one...
	¥¥¥¥ Walking on Air- the mutant can literally walk on air- a kind of
	slow levitation or flight.  This is a Dexterity + Mass Shifting roll
	(diff 6).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Cross the Barrier- the mutant can travel dimensions by
	realigning herself to a new dimension's 'phase'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Aggressive Realignment- requires the Stunt: Cross the Barrier.
	The mutant can enter a new dimension out of Quantum Phase, and when
	she comes in, she will be 'written into' this new dimension's history.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Resistance to Fate- the mutant may purchase the Power:
	Resistance to Fate with Experience Points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Walkabout- the mutant can travel time back and forth, and
	realign herself to a new time when she comes out of Quantum Shift.


							THE MATTER LIST

	There are several Powers that manipulate matter, and many of them
	affect one particular substance only.  This is a list of types of
	matter that can be manipulated with all of these powers. The substances
	under the double-cost heading make associated powers double-cost and
	may not be allowed by the Storyteller.  Ask first.  Note that some
	substances are homogeneous or even elemental (like oxygen) while
	eithers are quite heterogeneous (like dirt).  Obviously, many more
	types of matter exist than are treated here; consult the ST to
	determine the relative cost of these substances (and whether or not
	they are allowed).
	
Single Cost Types-- common substances that, of themselves, present no
immediate damaging effect on contact with human flesh:
	Any common element that is gaseous at room temperature (oxygen,
	  hydrogen, etc.)
	Air (as per normal atmosphere, whether that's earth's atmosphere or
	  wherever the mutant happens to come from-- a mixture of nitrogen,
	  oxygen, water vapour, and carbon dioxide with trace gases)
	Any common, naturally occuring compound that is gaseous at room
	  temperature, and is not caustic or actively poisonous, even if it is
	  not breathable (including methane, but not nerve gas or sour gas)
	Any element that is liquid at room temperature (mercury, bromine)
	Any common, naturally occuring compound, mixture or suspension that is
	  liquid at room temperature (water, milk, etc.) that is not caustic,
	  actively poisonous, etc.
	Any common element that is solid at room temperature (carbon, iron,
	  aluminum, etc.)
	Any common, naturally occuring compound, alloy, etc. that is solid at
	  room temperature, that is not alive, radioactive, caustic, or
	  otherwise immediately injurious to human flesh (steel, dirt, plastic,
	  etc.)
Double Cost Types-- substances that are either rare, hazardous/damaging,
or both:
	Poisons, such as arsenic, nerve gas, etc.
	Radioactive or unstable substances such as plutonium, cesium, etc.
	Caustic substances, including acids, bases, and other aggressive
	  solvents
	Highly reactive substances, including fluorine or francium
	Rare or highly valuable substances, such as gold or platinum
	Powerful/rare substances, such as adamantium, vibranium, carbonadium,
	  kryptonite (be sure to check with the ST before using one of these).
	Substances are not created at room temperature, such as magma, or
	  solid oxygen
	

Matter Absorption and Conversion (Physical/Social) [AL]
	A mutant with this power can absorb a certain sort of matter (be it
	iron, dirt, or water) and can convert it to some other form in his
	body.  The Sentinels have the ability to absorb electronics and metals
	of all sorts to repair themselves.  In the same vein, the mutant's
	body processes the material and makes it available for his use.  The
	necessary mass of one unit of matter varies with the type.  This
	requires a Stamina + Matter A/C roll (diff 3 + the number of units
	absorbed).

	Common Variations:
	* Health Conversion- each unit of matter absorbed is converted to a
	Health level of damage healed.
	* Energy Conversion- if the mutant has an energy emission power, he can
	add an automatic damage success for every point absorbed.  If not, this
	effect duplicates the energy emission power, save that the mutant does
	not generate energy unconsciously.  Dex + Directed Blast to hit.
	* Armour up- the mutant's flesh takes on the characteristics of the
	matter that he absorbs, which may allow him to blend in and will
	often give extra soak dice.  (One per unit of matter absorbed)
	Lasts one scene.
	* Projectiles- the mutant can redirect the matter absorbed as a
	projectile attack, which has one damage die in its pool per unit
	absorbed.
	* Reshape- the mutant can eject the absorbed matter after reshaping it
	internally with an Intelligence + Matter A/C roll.  The mutant's skills
	and knowledges (Repair, Science, Technology, etc.) and other Powers
	(Hyper-Invention, Organic Invention, etc.) may influence the complexity
	of the items that can be created.

	Special Variant: Absorb-All*- the mutant may elect to absorb any kind
	of inorganic matter, taking on appropriate characteristics by doing
	so.

	The size of a particular unit of matter is at the option of the
	Storyteller.

	¥ One unit of matter can be absorbed per round.
	¥¥ Two units of matter can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥ Three units of matter can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥¥ Four units of matter can be absorbed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five units of matter can be absorbed.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven units.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine units.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven units.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen units.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen units.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Matter- the mutant can store one unit of matter per point
	of Stamina in his body.  Particularly nasty bits of matter (like
	uranium) can have ill effects on you if you store it for too long,
	though.

Matter Body (Physical/Social) [AL/AN]
	This brutal power allows the mutant to change the composition of his
	body entirely to a certain kind of matter.  Hydro Man has this power,
	and Terra Firma, and Colossus, and Iceman.  No roll is required except
	under the most interesting circumstances (Stamina + Matter Body). This
	power normally has some corollary powers (such as increased physical
	stats) associated with it, but the kind of matter generally determines
	the increase in physicals to a certain extent.  Nevertheless, the
	maximum increases are as follows:

	¥ One point Strength and Stamina, or two points in one
	¥¥ Two points each Strength and Stamina, or three points in one
	¥¥¥ Three points each Strength and Stamina, or five points in one
	¥¥¥¥ Four points each Strength and Stamina, or six points in one
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points each Strength and Stamina, or eight points in one
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ As Rank five, but Dexterity may be substituted for Strength
	or Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Six points each any two attributes, or nine points in one
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Seven points each any two attributes, or eleven points in
	one
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Eight points each any two attributes, or twelve points in
	one
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Nine points each any two attributes, or fourteen points
	in one
	
	Note that you can not change the attribute bonus once you've chosen it
	for your Rank!

	Vicente has a nifty version of this power (actually, he bought the
	power twice)- he can change into a chemically inert liquid or a gas.

	Sample Collateral Powers:
	Acid*- brawling attacks inflict aggravated damage.
	Diamond*- an extra Health Level per Rank and Light Absorption/Conversion
	(Mirrorform) as rank 1, with an option to purchase it with Exp.
	Earth- level 1 healing factor while attached to ground.
	Gas- level 1 dispersion, with the option to purchase it with Exp.
	Ice*- attacks inflict one point of cold damage per Rank.
	Magma*- brawling attacks inflict heat damage (lights up flammable
	  materials when a '10' is rolled for damage).
	Metal- all Strength difficulties are reduced by one.
	Tar- level 1 entrapment and adhesion, and option to purchase both
	Sand- shapeshifting rank 1 and one auto soak vs. blunt trauma per Rank.
	Water- as shapeshifting rank 1 and an automatic soak success vs.
	  physical damage per Rank.

	Variation: Matter Mimic*- The Absorbing Man in Marvel Comics, and
	Grunge in Image Comics both have this variation, which is the ability
	to change the composition of your body to match any material that you
	come into contact with. As with the regular Matter Body, coherence is
	still possible, even in liquid or gaseous form, though it might become
	difficult.  Your physical attributes will vary with the material that
	you mimic as above.  It usually takes a full turn to mimic a material.
	Roll Stamina + Matter Body- diff is 6 for solids, 7 for liquids, 9
	for gasses.
	
	Variation: Matter Body Animation (Mental)- your mutant does not shift
	his own body into stone or metal, but instead projects his
	consciousness into a pre-made body, animating it and leaving his
	regular body vulnerable. This has the advantage that the matter body
	can be destroyed without destroying the hero, but her regular body is
	vulnerable so long as she is animating the Matter Body.  The regular
	body will starve or dehydrate eventually if it the mutant does not
	return to it (or arrange for its care).  The mutant may create any
	number of appropriate bodies in advance, or may animate one made by
	someone else if it is of the appropriate type.  The matter body must be
	within line of sight for the mutant to animate it.
	
	Special Flaw: Statue (3 point Flaw)- if the mutant's Matter Body is
	composed of something that is not normally flexible, then he will
	not be able to move when in this form.  This is only worth one point
	with the Matter Mimic variation.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Shift Form- the mutant can change consciously between the matter
	body and an unarmoured form.
	¥¥ Life Support- The Life support power may be bought with experience,
	even if the mutant did not start play with it.
	¥¥ Partial Shift- requires the Stunt: Shift Form.  The character can
	alter the form of one body part at a time, as per Shift Form.
	¥¥¥ Body Armour- This Power Stunt allows a mutant to buy the Body
	Armour Power with experience, even if she did not start the game
	with this power.
	¥¥¥ Matter Absorption- the mutant can purchase the Matter Absorption/
	Conversion Power with experience points, even if he did not start
	the game with this ability.
	¥¥¥¥ Matter Movement- the mutant, when in his Matter Body form, can
	move freely (though slowly, if it is a solid) through the sort of
	matter that he is composed of.  Thus, Iceman would be able to travel
	through glaciers if he took this stunt.  This is a Dexterity +
	Matter Body (difficulty 7) action to initiate.
	¥¥¥¥ Scatter- if the mutant's matter body is fluid (sand, water, tar,
	etc.), he may split his body into multiple 'strands', which may
	move in several directions at once.  Each strand has a maximum dice
	pool proportional to the amount of 'body' it represents (a strand that
	contains only one quarter of the mutant's body only has 1/4 dice pools)
	He may stay 'scattered' for one round per point of Stamina, and one
	additional round per point of Healing Factor.  The difficulty is 7 to
	split into two parts; each additional section increases the difficulty
	by one.

Matter Body Parts (Physical/Social) [AN]
	One of the mutant's body parts is permanently composed of some odd
	type of matter (usually inorganic).  This is not a voluntary or
	temporary condition, as with such Powers as Energy Body.  The part
	is a living component of the character's body, and will perform its
	functions faithfully, but it will have some attributes that a regular
	part of its type would not.  No roll is required.
	
	Note that this Power operates in the same wise as Extra Body Parts; it
	should be considered a one-time purchase rather than a Power that can
	be improved-- except under exceptional circumstances as approved by the
	Storyteller.

	The affected part gets one point of Strength and Stamina for all
	purposes, and the possibility of collateral Powers.  Moreover, the
	affected part is immune to the effects of such Powers as Masquing and
	Biomanipulation.

	Sample Collateral Powers:
	Acid*- brawling attacks inflict aggravated damage.
	Diamond*- an extra Health Level per Rank and Light Absorption/Conversion
	(Mirrorform) as rank 1, with an option to purchase it with Exp.
	Earth- level 1 healing factor while attached to ground.
	Gas- level 1 dispersion, with the option to purchase it with Exp.
	Ice*- attacks inflict one point of cold damage per Rank.
	Magma*- brawling attacks inflict heat damage (lights up flammable
	  materials when a '10' is rolled for damage).
	Metal- all Strength difficulties for the affected part are reduced by 
	  one.
	Tar- level 1 entrapment and adhesion, and option to purchase both
	Sand- shapeshifting rank 1 and one auto soak vs. blunt trauma per Rank.
	Water- shapeshifting rank 1 and an automatic soak success vs. physical
	  damage per Rank.

	¥ A part such as a sense organ (eye, ear, nose), the interior of the mouth,
	the mutant's hair, or her teeth could be composed of some form of matter--
	a hand or foot would also do.  Basically, any smaller part is eligible.
	¥¥ An entire arm or leg (or other limb-- including a tail or tentacle if
	he happens to have one), a vital organ such as the heart, stomach, or brain.
	¥¥¥ An entire collection of organs or a system.  The digestive tract, 
	respiratory/circulatory system, or even the skin.  A pair of arms or legs,
	or even wings, if the mutant happens to have them.

Matter Bonding (Social) [AL]
	Like the Dog Welder, your mutant has the ability to make solid
	objects bond to each other, without resort to chemicals, gravity
	manipulation, or electricity.  Rather, the mutant can create adhesive
	bonds between solids that are so powerful that separation will cause
	structural damage.  For the power to function, the mutant must be
	touching one of the objects, which must (perforce) be touching the
	other object.  Each round, the mutant can strengthen the bond a
	little bit more, until his maximum adhesive level has been reached.
	Thus, a mutant with Matter Bonding ¥¥¥ can create the equivalent of
	a Rank one bond the first round, a Rank two bond the second, and
	then finally a Rank three bond the third round.  The bond does not
	penetrate deeply into the objects, but enough that to remove the
	bonded 'sections' would inflict the same damage (at least) as
	simply pulling them apart.  No roll is required, except possibly
	a Dex + Brawl roll to touch the objects to each other.

	¥ Requires a Strength of 2 to separate the objects.  Separation
	inflicts two Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥ Requires a Strength of 3 to separate the objects, which inflicts
	three Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥¥ Four Strength and damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Five Strength and damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Six Strength and damage.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven Strength and damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine Strength, seven damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven Strength, eight damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen Strength, nine damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen Strength, ten damage.

Matter Control (Social) [AL]
	The mutant can manipulate one particular kind of matter, be it ice,
	iron, water, or oxygen.  The matter will shape itself into whatever
	form the mutant chooses (quickly or sluggishly, depending on its
	density and hardness) without changing overall mass or volume.  In
	any case, a solid can be made to behave as a fluid, a gas can force
	its way underwater, a liquid can be parted (though not made to
	float in mid-air...)  There are any number of possibilities.  This
	is typically a Manipulation + Matter Control roll.  See the Power:
	Earth Control for some guidelines on attacking.

	¥ Up to 5 pounds of matter may be manipulated
	¥¥ Up to 25 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥ Up to 125 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥ Up to 625 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to 3,125 pounds of matter
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Up to 15,625 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Up to 78,125 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Up to 390,625 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Up to 1,953,125 pounds of matter
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to 9,765,625 pounds of matter

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Weaponry Forging- The mutant can forge weapons out of the matter
	he/she controls.  Roll the mutant's Manipulation + Matter Control,
	difficulty 6.  For every success on this roll, the weapon will have an
	additional damage die.  One success equals Strength + 1 weapon or a
	damage 1 missile weapon.
	
Matter Creation (Social) [AL]
	The mutant can call a particular form of matter into existence, be it
	ice, iron, water, or oxygen.  The mass of matter that can be created
	depends upon whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas.  Iceman has the
	ability to create ice (wow!).  The matter will continue to exist for
	one minute per Rank that the mutant achieves in this Power.  The
	Storyteller adjudicates this time-lapse.  After the time is up, the
	matter fades.  Until then, it acts like normal matter and can be
	prevented from leaving by chemically changing it in some way (breathe
	the oxygen or turn iron into iron oxide), though this would normally
	limit the usefulness of this power.  I apologize for expressing mass by
	using a weight measurement.  This Power requires an Intelligence +
	Matter Creation roll (diff 6)

	The matter appears in a spot within line-of-sight, as designated by the
	mutant.	It will not intersect other matter (though it is capable of
	expelling gasses and even liquids if there is no other available space,
	it cannot expel solid matter).
	
	¥ Create up to one pound of the matter
	¥¥ Create five pounds or less
	¥¥¥ Create twenty-five pounds or less
	¥¥¥¥ Create 125 pounds or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ Create 625 pounds or less
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Create 3,125 pounds or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Create up to 15,625 pounds
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Create 78,125 pounds or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Create up to 390,625 pounds
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Create up to 1,953,125 pounds
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Shape matter- normally, the matter appears in a rough, unfinished
	shape.  If it is fluid, of course, it will immediately seek the shape
	of its container.  With this stunt, the successes that the mutant
	garners on the initial roll to create the matter will determine how
	closely it approximates the shape he wants, with 5 successes
	representing a perfect match (within reason-- it may not be the size he
	wants if he can't create enough of the substance).

Matter Hardening (Social) [AL]
	This Power will increase the apparent material strength of any object
	that the mutant applies it to.  This hardening may not last very long,
	or it may become permanent.  It may be applied to organic and
	inorganic materials, but matter that is meant to move (like humans)
	will begin to become rigid as well as hard (losing one die of
	Dexterity per Rank of this Power, if all of the Power is applied). 
	Hardened beings that lose all of their Dexterity become immobile.  The
	range of this Power is always touch (so only a being's skin or fur
	becomes hardened). The duration of the hardening depends on the number
	of successes on a Manipulation + Matter Hardening roll (difficulty 6).
	One or two successes equal one round per Rank; three or four
	successes equate to one day per Rank; five successes or more denote
	permanence (unless the target is living- then it equates to five days
	per Rank).  Unwilling living targets get a soak roll against this
	effect (diff 6).

	¥ Soft materials can be hardened slightly- about the hardness of
	copper. These materials get one extra Health Level.
	¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of bronze.  These
	materials get two extra Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of steel.  These
	materials get three extra Health Levels and two Stamina to soak with.
	¥¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of titanium.  These
	materials get four extra Health Levels and four Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of diamond.  These
	materials get five extra Health Levels and six Stamina.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of omnium.  These 
	materials get three auto-soak, six extra Health and six Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of standard
	adamantium.  These materials get four auto-soak, seven extra Health
	and seven Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of carbonadium.
	These get five auto-soak, eight extra Health and eight Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of true
	adamantium.  These get seven auto-soak, ten extra Health and ten
	Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Materials can be hardened to the strength of an
	adamantium/vibranium alloy.  These get ten auto-soak, fifteen extra
	Health and ten Stamina.

Matter Immunity (Physical) [AN]
	This is a very bizarre Power.  A mutant with Matter Immunity does not
	interact with one specific type of matter.  Period.  They can even
	occupy the same space, since they can't touch each other.  Thus, a
	mutant with an immunity to lead cannot be harmed by most bullets- they
	will damage his clothing on the way through, but that's about it.  A
	mutant with an immunity to steel won't be hurt by most swords, but on
	the other hand, he's pretty much committed to plastic forks and knives
	if he can't afford silverware.  A mutant with an immunity to water had
	better have some hefty Life Support, Physical Adaption, or some sort
	of Unique Physiology if he's going to survive, but at least he'll
	never drown.  No roll is required.

	Variation: Variable Immunity*- the mutant can choose to be Immune to
	any one type of matter at a time.  Switching the type of matter takes
	an action. [AN]

	¥¥ The mutant cannot react with one type of matter.  It is as if they
	do not exist for each other.

Matter Manipulation Body* (Physical/Social) [AL]
	Like DC's Metamorpho, the Element Man (eeyikes...) a mutant with this
	Power can change his body into any material he chooses, so long as
	he knows its chemical constituency (including chemical formula and
	types of bonds between its atoms/ions, etc.).  He could turn into
	rubber, or iron (needing only to know its number of protons, electrons,
	and neutrons, since it is an element), or even adamantium with this
	Power.  His mobility, Strength, Stamina, etc. are increased or reduced,
	depending on the nature of the substance that he has mimicked.  Make
	sure you've got that Chemistry Knowledge tucked firmly under your belt.
	Note that plutonium (an element) is much easier to mimic than simple
	dirt, since dirt has a complex and heterogeneous chemical composition!
	The mutant cannot effectively raise the Rank of this Power to a level
	higher than his Rank in Chemistry.  At lower Ranks, the mutant's
	body merely becomes laced with the substance- enough to mimic its
	effects to a certain extent, but not enough to increase or decrease
	his Physical stats by absurd levels.  A Stamina + Matter Manipulation
	roll is required (difficulty 6 for an easy element).  An Intelligence +
	Chemistry roll may well be required for complex substances.

	¥ Assume the form of any element.  The mutant is subject to some of
	the problems that may come from taking the form of that element-
	if he changes to potassium while swimming, that's his own fault.
	¥¥ Assume the form of any simple ionic substance, such as salt.
	¥¥¥ Assume the form of any simple molecular substance, like water.
	¥¥¥¥ Assume the form of simple alloys, like brass or steel, or more
	complex homogenous substances like styrofoam.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Assume the form the form of multi-molecular substances of
	great complexity (like blood).

	¥ No more than one point can be added or subtracted from Strength,
	Dexterity, or Stamina.
	¥¥ No more than two points
	¥¥¥ Three points
	¥¥¥¥ Four points
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥¥ Multiform- the mutant can change different parts of his body
	into different substances, so his skin could be made of glass while
	his insides were composed of sulfuric acid.  Yikes!

Matter Repulsion (Social) [AL]
	The mutant can has the ability to repel matter, which can be a
	very useful Power if properly harnessed.  This is related to, but
	not the same as, Telekinesis and Gravity Control.  The Rank of
	the Power relates to the equivalent Strength score of the repulsion
	effect.  Matter is pushed away in all directions from the mutant,
	and from every surface of his body.  The measure of effectiveness
	depends on the weight of the matter and its physical state- gasses
	merely swirl at any level, and liquids only retreat if they are
	dense (level 4 is sufficient to repel water from all sides, while
	mercury retreats at level 2).  This Power requires only that the
	mutant be conscious; only turning it on or off requires any
	concentration- this is a Charisma + Matter Repulsion Roll (diff 5).

	Special Flaw: Low-level Static (4-point Flaw)- the mutant constantly
	radiates a Strength one Matter Repulsion effect- this cannot be shut
	off.  The upshot of this is that it is very difficult for the mutant
	to pick up small objects (they keep scooting away) or sneak up on
	someone in a cluttered room, or read a book (the pages are pinned to
	the spine), and he is easy (-2 difficulty) to disarm.  Oops.

	¥ All matter is repelled from the mutant as if pushed by someone
	with a Strength of 3.
	¥¥ Strength 4
	¥¥¥ Strength 5
	¥¥¥¥ Strength 6
	¥¥¥¥¥ Strength 8
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Strength 10
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Strength 12
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Strength 14
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Strength 16 (!)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Strength 18 (!!)

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Dampen Blow- the mutant has one extra die to soak with per Rank.
	¥ Flight- The Mutant can fly low, up to rank strength in meters above
	the ground. i.e., at Rank ¥¥¥ 5 meters up.  The effective speed, however,
	is only 5 x	rank mph.
	¥¥¥ Focused blast- the mutant may add one die per Rank to the
	effective Strength of the repulsion by narrowing the repulsion effect
	to a narrow beam.  This requires concentration (Dexterity + Matter
	Repulsion diff 7).

Matter Sheath (Social) [AL/AN]
	A mutant with this Power selects a particular form of matter, and can
	then surround all or part of her body with this substance.  The
	substance in question moves with her body, even if it is normally a
	rigid substance.  This substance is spontaneously 'created' or borrowed
	from somewhere, and it can be interacted with normally (if the
	substance is oxygen, for example, the mutant can breathe it normally. 
	Since the substance conforms to the mutant's body, it will displace
	liquids and solids (even if that would mean behaviour that is unusual
	for the substance-- an air sheath will continue to surround the mutant
	even when he is underwater, for example).  The system to activate this
	Power is Manipulation + Matter Sheath (diff 6).  Note that the
	substance will vanish if it is somehow moved too far away from the
	mutant's body, even if it is transformed in some way (chemical
	reactions, etc.)
	
	Variation: Powerful Sheath-- for three extra Freebie points, the Sheath
	offers collateral abilities as per the Power: Matter Body, but only
	while the Sheath is active.
	
	¥ A flexible sheath of matter, covering all or part of the mutant's
	body, can be created.  Note that if the mutant covers his eyes and
	nose with a liquid or opaque substance, it's his own fault if he
	can't see or breathe.  Up to two dice can be added to one of the 
	mutant's dice pools, if appropriate (for example, a metallic sheath
	might add dice to the mutant's Stamina pool for soaking purposes,
	while an acidic sheath might add dice to the mutant's damage pool
	while brawling).  There must be some rationale for such a bonus;
	not all forms of matter might offer dice bonuses in this wise.
	¥¥ Up to four dice might be added to one dice pool, or divided among
	two dice different dice pools.  Note that this should be a stable
	arrangement: the same sheath should not add a bonus to damage pools
	one week, and instead influence stealth pools another week.
	¥¥¥ Up to six dice might be added to a single dice pool, or divided
	among up to three different dice pools.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to eight dice might be added to a single dice pool, or
	divided among up to four different dice pools.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to ten dice might be added to a single dice pool, or divided
	among up to five different dice pools.
	
Matter Transference/Reconstruction (Social) [AL]
	A variation on teleportation with an important difference, this Power
	does not move things from one place to another; rather, it takes them
	apart in one place (converting them to their separate elemental 
	components) and then rebuilds them in another, using the available 
	matter and energy to do so.  Thus, it can be used strategically in 
	several ways- both as a potential source of raw materials and as a 
	means of taking materials away from others.  Living creatures cannot 
	be used as source material for reconstruction.  The thing to be 
	deconstructed must be within normal visual range.  A Wits +
	Matter Transference Roll (difficulty 4 + effective Rank of the
	effect by mass and/or range) is required.

	¥ The range of this Power is 100 metres.  The maximum mass that
	can be affected is 100 pounds.  The requisite amount of matter must
	exist for the object to be reconstructed, and in the proper types 
	(if the recipe calls for 3 mg of selenium, then it had better be 
	there, by cracky).  Special properties (like life, or enchantment) 
	cannot be transferred.
	¥¥ The range is 1 mile.  The maximum mass affected is 500 pounds.  
	Same restrictions for types and amount of matter present.  Special 
	properties cannot be transferred.
	¥¥¥ The range is 30 miles.  The maximum mass affected is one ton.
	Same restrictions for amount of matter present, but the type of 
	matter that is available is irrelevant.  Life can be transferred.
	¥¥¥¥ The range is 1000 miles.  The maximum mass affected is 10 
	tons. If enough energy is present, it can be used in lieu of matter.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range is anywhere on Earth.  The maximum mass affected is
	100 tons.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The range is anywhere in the universe.  The maximum mass
	affected is 10 kilotons.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Apportation- rather than sending things away, the mutant may
	elect to bring especially familiar things to him.  This requires
	a certain level of familiarity (a tree fort that he spent a lot
	of time in as a kid, for instance) and a certainty that the object
	is in a certain location.  A Psychic Link (q.v.) would also suffice
	for this purpose.  Perception + Matter Transference, diff standard.
	¥¥ Modification- the item can be slightly modified (color, cosmetic
	details etc.) during the Transference.
	¥¥¥ Self-dissolution: the mutant can transport himself in this way.
	¥¥¥ Time lapse: so long as he maintains concentration, the mutant 
	can wait before he reconstructs something that has been transferred.
	This requires a successful Willpower check (diff 7) each round.  If 
	he fails, the object is lost forever.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Transfer other- requires the Stunt: Self-dissolution.  The
	mutant must be intimately familiar with a person that is to be
	teleported in this way (or have such as Power as Bioarchitect's
	Sight, in the case of strangers).

Mechanist's Sight (Mental) [AN]
	This bizarre ability, known only to Forge in the Marvel Universe,
	allows a mutant to literally see the relationships between the parts
	of a machine, and intuitively understand them.  This power allows
	the mutant to use normal machines, Techno-Fetishes, and even
	Magickal Devices after a cursory inspection of them.  It also allows
	the mutant to instantly see what is wrong with a damaged or flawed
	technological artifact.  This is a Rank ¥¥ power, and cannot be
	improved with experience.  Perception + Technology (diff 4) is the
	normal roll.
	
	¥¥ The mutant can see how a technological item functions just by
	looking at it.  Lowers all difficulties for using, designing, or
	repairing an item by 3.
		
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Hyper-Repair/Hyper Technology- the mutant may improve the Repair
	and Technology skills past the 5th level with experience with this
	Power Stunt in his toolbox.  These skills only cost (1 x current)
	to improve with experience for this mutant.
	¥¥ Fatal Flaw- the mutant can see the flaws in a machine (or robot,
	or cyborg) and exploit them.  A Perception + Technology roll will
	give one extra damage success in combat or reveal one flaw per
	success.  This is a diff 5 roll.

Meditative Focus (Mental) [AH/AL]
	While many people can learn meditation, some mutants have a special
	talent that they can unlock using the power of their minds- a talent
	that uses the Meditation Skill (not on the sheet).  Mutants with
	this Power can gain extraordinary insights and abilities through
	meditation.  Each Rank in this Power represents a different ability,
	and may have a different system.  All such abilities use the Skill:
	Meditation.

	¥ The mutant can perform a special cleansing meditation, which acts as
	a full hour of rest for the purpose of recovering from strenuous
	activity.  This type of meditation lasts one minute.  If the mutant
	meditates for an hour, he gets the benefit of a full night's sleep. 
	This is a Perception + Meditation roll (diff 4)
	¥¥ The mutant can take a minute to focus his attention through
	meditation on a particular Talent, Skill, or Knowledge that he
	possesses.  This allows him to add his Meditation score to all dice
	pools using that particular Ability, but also gives a +2 difficulty to
	all other actions until the mutant performs a brief (minute-long)
	cleansing meditation.  No more points may be added to any dice pool
	than the mutant already possesses in the Ability in question.  This
	requires a Wits + Meditation roll (diff 6).
	¥¥¥ The mutant can set up an active mind barrier while meditating
	which makes it difficult for telepaths to realize that he is there,
	unless they are actively looking for him.  The mutant's mind is
	difficult to notice, and all difficulties to detect him using
	Telepathy or certain forms of Mutant Detection are at +2.  The
	mutant's difficulties are at +2 for all actions while in this trance.
	This is a Perception + Meditation roll (diff 8).
	¥¥¥¥ No-Mind: the mutant can actually perform without a conscious
	thought process, which makes him absolutely immune to the Telepathic
	ability Deliver Imperative and gives him three automatic successes
	against other attempts to dominate his mind or emotions.  No
	truly complex actions requiring creativity (like conversation)
	can be performed by the mutant while in this state.  To enter this
	trance requires a Wits + Meditation roll (diff 8).  All other
	difficulties are at +1.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Healing trance: the mutant can recover one Health Level of
	non-aggravated damage per hour of uninterrupted meditation.  This
	requires a Stamina + Meditation roll (diff 6).

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Environmental awareness: the mutant can enter a trance that
	puts her at one with her environment, effectively giving her the
	Powers: Environmental Awareness, Organless Senses, and Spatial
	Sense as long as she remains in the trance.  This requires a
	Perception + Meditation roll (diff 7).  All difficulties for the
	mutant (apart from Perceptive ones) are at +1 while she is in
	this trance.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Meditative link: the mutant can communicate, mind to mind,
	with any other person in the world who is currently meditating.
	This requires an hour of preparation and a Charisma + Meditation roll 
	(diff 7).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Astral Body: the mutant can take on a form made of pure
	mental energy, and project it onto the Astral Plane like a telepath.
	His own body is placed in suspended animation, slowing his body
	functions by 80%, until his spirit returns.  This is an Intelligence
	and Meditation roll (diff 8), requiring three successes, and taking up
	two hours of preparation, and one hour per failed roll.  Successes are
	not cumulative.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Umbral Body: the mutant can enter the Mindscape, Dreamscape,
	or Umbra using meditation, requiring two hours of preparation, and
	inflicting five Health Levels of damage on the mutant's body (this is
	not soakable, except by mutants with Invulnerability, who get one soak
	die per Rank).  Difficulty and duration as Astral Body above.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Realized Mind: the mutant is in a constant state of
	meditation, and can enter any sort of trance instantly, at diff 4.
	Difficulty penalties for other actions are reduced by one.

Mega-Attribute (Physical/Social/Mental -- see above) [AN]
	Whatever the source of this power, the mutant has preternatural ability
	in one of his attributes, wielding great strength, incredible beauty,
	or perceptive powers beyond the normal scope of humanity.  The Hulk,
	Storm, and Wolverine, respectively, have such Mega-Attributes.

	When the mutant uses the Attribute that has been enhanced by this Power,
	she adds her Rank in it to the dice pool.  Thus, a mutant who has a 
	Strength of 3 and Mega-Strength ¥¥ rolls five dice for damage when she
	throws a punch.  

	Note: any character can improve the Attributes in her Primary category
	above 5 with Experience without the use of this Power; however, such
	characters do not have access to the stunts for the appropriate
	Mega-Attribute.
	
	In addition, the difficulty of rolls associated with the Mega-Attribute
	are reduced.  For example, soak rolls for someone with Mega-Stamina are
	reduced in difficulty.  Note that this _does not_ stack with reductions
	from other Powers!  Thus, if someone with Invulnerability also has
	Mega-Stamina, the player takes the best reduction for soak rolls, not
	the combined score.
	
	¥ Add one to the dice pool of the associated Attribute.  Difficulties
	to use the associated Attribute are reduced by 1 (difficulty six
	becomes difficulty five).
	¥¥ Add two to the dice pool of the associated Attribute.  Difficulties
	to use the associated Attribute are reduced by 1.  These reductions are
	not cumulative.
	¥¥¥ Add three to dice pools.  Difficulties are reduced by 2.
	¥¥¥¥ Add four to dice pools.  Diff -2.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Add five to dice pools.  Diff -3.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Add six to dice pools.  Diff -3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Add seven to dice pools.  Diff -3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Add eight to dice pools.  Diff -4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Add nine to dice pools.  Diff -4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Add ten to dice pools.  Diff -5 (minimum difficulty of 2).
	
	Mega-Strength Power Stunts:
	¥ Crush- the mutant has learned to inflict lethal damage with this
	Power, rather than merely bruising damage.  The mutant must prepare
	himself by taking a round to 'psych up', and then attacks with a
	crushing blow.  He must take this round to focus each time he wants
	to inflict lethal damage with his bare hands.
	¥ Javelin- the mutant is adept at throwing things a great distance, or
	exerting force to send opponents flying.  This can cause up to the
	mutant's Rank in Mega-Strength as extra damage, most often Bruising
	but sometimes Lethal, depending on what the missile lands on.  Figure
	that a mutant with Rank ¥ Mega-Strength can throw something up to his
	maximum press to a distance of 20 feet with this Stunt (perhaps double
	the normal limit); each additional Rank of Mega-Strength increases
	that distance by a factor of ten.
	¥ Lifter- the mutant has a much-refined ability to lift great weights,
	even beyond those of mutants without this Stunt.  He may increase his
	maximum press by two times for every success he gets on a Strength +
	Might roll (thus, five successes yields an incredible thirty-two times
	the mutant's natural lifting power.  To a mutant who can normally lift
	one hundred tons, this is appalling).  This does not add any dice to
	combat rolls.
	¥ Might- the mutant may purchase the Might ability with Experience
	points, which he can use in combination with Strength whenever he is
	making a Strength check of some kind.  Might is also included in the
	pool to determine your mutant's maximum press.  This ability does not
	apply to damage rolls.
	¥ Muscle Control- the mutant can control how much damage he deals with
	each blow, not by restricting the number of dice he uses, but by choosing
	how many successes he wants to use _after_ the dice are rolled.
	¥¥ Hyper-Leaping- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hyper-Leaping with
	Experience points.
	¥¥¥ Shockwave- like the Incredible Hulk, the mutant can strike the
	ground with fist or foot to cause tremors in the immediate area.  All
	people and objects touching the ground in a radius of Mega-Strength x
	10 metres takes damage equal to the mutant's Rank in Mega-Strength, and
	must successfully make a Dexterity + Athletics roll (diff 8) or
	Dexterity + Acrobatics roll (diff 6) to avoid falling to the ground.
	¥¥¥ Thunderclap- an evil Power Stunt that allows the mutant to clap his
	hands together, sending a lethal blast of compressed air in a certain
	direction.  This can affect one target standing up to Mega-Strength x 5
	feet away, and inflicts the mutant's Mega-Strength Rank in lethal or
	bashing damage (player's option) against the target.  This will not
	damage particularly soft objects (like clothing) or hard objects (like
	stone), but people, glass, etc. are in some danger.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Kiai- the mutant may concentrate and put all of his considerable
	Strength behind a blow with a sudden burst of effort.  No roll is
	required; the Strength test is considered to have succeeded fully (one
	success per die in the pool).  It takes a round to 'psych up' for a
	Kiai.  This is very exhausting, and the mutant will be at -2 to all
	actions until he rests for at least an hour.  Requires the Stunt:
	Crush.

	Mega-Dexterity Power Stunts:
	¥ Accuracy- when the mutant takes a turn to focus his energies, he
	gains three automatic successes in any standard difficulty dice pool
	involving Dexterity.
	¥ Enhanced Movement- the mutant can't compete with someone who has 
	Rage or Hyper-Speed, but he can get around.  The mutant's top running
	speed is multiplied by his Rank in Mega-Dexterity for short bursts.
	¥ Flexibility- many mutants with Mega-Dexterity (like Nightcrawler
	and Spider-Man) have the flexibility of circus contortionists.  A
	mutant with this Stunt can fit his body through small spaces, and can
	even separate his joints, if necessary- he can fit through any space
	that is as wide as the distance between one side of his head and the
	opposite shoulder.  He also gains his Mega-Dexterity Rank in extra
	dice to escape bonds, and has one automatic success in all Acrobatics
	rolls.
	¥ Omnidexterity- The mutant can use both hands and feet with equal
	facility; all manipulative limbs (including tentacles, etc. if the
	mutant has them) are equally agile.
	¥ Perfect Balance- like the Beast, the mutant has the ability to
	tell which end is up, no matter what the situation.  He gains an
	extra two dice to resist Vertigo attacks, and ignores all ones in any
	Athletics roll for keeping balance or successfully landing a jump.
	¥¥ Abort Physical Action- if the mutant's declared action has become
	void due to circumstances, she can default and switch it at no penalty
	so long as both the declared action and the new action are physical
	in nature.
	¥¥¥ Body Supremacy- the mutant has intimate knowledge, familiarity,
	and control over his muscles, capable of flexing them individually or
	in sequence to enable such feats as inching slowly along the floor
	using only the muscles on his back, blasting a swallowed poison up
	out of (or on through) his digestive system, or even increasing the
	difficulty to recognize him by one by rearranging the muscles in his
	face.
	¥¥¥¥ Recovery- any failed Dexterity roll can be re-rolled once at
	a +1 difficulty (or one extra success required, if the difficulty
	was 10).  The second result, whether it is better or worse than the
	first, is accepted.

	Mega-Stamina Power Stunts:
	¥ Durability- the mutant's body is extremely durable indeed, and
	all aggravated damage to his body is treated merely as lethal damage.
	¥ Fast Healer- the mutant heals at the rate of one Health Level per
	day.  This is not cumulative with other healing Powers such as
	Accelerated Recovery or Healing factor.
	¥ Hardbody- the mutant's epidermis has become extremely tough.
	Whenever an attack against the mutant scores no damage on the dice
	roll (not because of soak, etc.), the weapon that struck him will
	break if the mutant rolls at least three successes on a Stamina roll.
	Of course, some objects (like ones fashioned of adamantium or
	vibranium) are not breakable in this way.
	¥ Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Talent: Resistance with
	Experience points.  This allows him to temporarily restore dice
	lost due to chemicals or dice penalties (Stamina + Resistance,
	difficulty 7, each success restores one lost die for a number of
	rounds equal to the mutant's Willpower).
	¥ Staying Power- the mutant may engage in high-exertion activities
	for much longer periods than normal-- up to one hour per Rank in
	Mega-Stamina.
	¥¥ Slow Processes- with the expenditure of a point of Power
	Charge, the mutant may slow down his metabolism and decrease the
	needs of his body.  He may choose to 'sacrifice' one die from all
	Strength, Dexterity, and Wits dice pools per point of
	Mega-Stamina.  In so doing, he may extend the time between meals,
	breaths, etc. by a factor of ten per die.  Thus, normally the
	mutant eats every four hours and takes one breath per second
	comfortably.  With the expenditure of one die, he eats every two
	days and takes a breath every ten seconds.  With two dice, he gets
	hungry every month or so and takes a breath every two minutes...
	¥¥ True Grit- the mutant's incredible muscular Stamina allows him to
	add his Rank in Mega-Stamina to the dice pools for any sustained
	Strength rolls.
	¥¥¥ Pain is Nothing- the mutant may purchase the Power: Pain 
	Immunity with Experience.
	¥¥¥¥ Last Man Standing- any time the mutant is part of a group
	of people who must make Stamina checks, his will to go on is such
	that he may spend a point of Willpower to match the successes of
	the person who performs best, if that is not him.  This works 
	when the mutant fails his roll, but does not work with botches.

	Mega-Perception Power Stunts:
	¥ Awareness- The mutant can buy the Awareness Talent.
	¥ Discrimination- The mutant may buy the Power: Discrimination
	with Experience.
	¥ ESP- The mutant always gets a chance to detect hidden objects or
	people, even if they have been specially shielded from his senses.
	¥ Heightened Senses- The mutant can buy the Power: Heightened
	Senses with Experience.
	¥ Intuition- The mutant can buy the Intuition Talent.
	¥ Spatial Awareness- The mutant may buy the Power: Altered Perceptions
	(Spatial Sense) with Experience.
	¥¥ Detect sentience- The mutant can detect intelligent beings at a
	distance that varies with the number of successes.
	¥¥ Enhanced Smell- After buying this stunt, the mutant has -2
	diff to all rolls involving smells, and the mutant may track by
	smell.
	¥¥ Sense Deference- With a Perception + Intimidation roll, the mutant
	may determine, when he walks into a social situation, who is in charge 
	and who fears whom.
	¥¥¥ Mutant Detection- the mutant may buy the Power: Detection (Mutant)
	with Experience.  It cannot be improved beyond the first Rank.
	¥¥¥ Sense Mega-Attribute- by watching a person for a round, the mutant
	can make a Perception + Alertness roll to detect Mega-Attributes.
	Mega-Appearance is obvious, of course.  Mega-Strength, Mega-Dexterity,
	Mega-Perception and Mega-Intelligence are difficulty 6.  Mega-Wits
	and Mega-Charisma are difficulty 7.  Mega-Stamina is difficulty 8, and
	Mega-Manipulation (unfortunately) cannot be detected.  One success is
	enough to determine the presence of Mega-Attributes.  Three successes
	gives the mutant an idea +/- one Rank, and five successes nails it.
	¥¥¥¥ New View- the mutant may purchase any Altered Perceptions Power
	with Experience.

	Mega-Intelligence Power Stunts:
	¥ Enhanced Memory- a mutant with this Stunt has excellent recall
	for minute physical detail.  He receives a bonus of one automatic
	success per point of Mega-Intelligence to any roll to see if he
	recalls the physical details of a person, place, or thing (including
	recognition, etc.)
	¥ Great Scholar- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hyper-Scholarship
	with Experience.
	¥ Linguistic Genius- The mutant may buy the Power: Hyper-Linguistics
	with Experience.
	¥ Quick Learner- with this Stunt, the mutant may improve any Knowledge
	at a rate of 1 x current instead of 2 x current with Experience.
	¥ Widely Read- A mutant with this Stunt has one "shadow point" in all 
	Knowledges owing to his vast store of knowledge.  These points are
	imaginary; the mutant must buy the first rank in a Knowledge before
	he can improve it to the second rank.
	¥¥ Leap of Logic- the mutant's thought processes are swifter than her
	conscious awareness can keep up with.  She may add her Intuition score
	(if any) to all Knowledge rolls.
	¥¥¥ Skepticism- any Power such as a Mega-Attribute, Persuasion, or
	some uses of Telepathy that involve changing a mutant's mind by
	accepting a number of propositions (rather than Voice of Command,
	which just uses brute force) may be resisted by a secondary roll
	of the mutant's Intelligence score, if a Willpower roll or initial
	system to resist the Power fails.
	¥¥¥¥ Towering Intellect- any time the mutant makes an Intelligence +
	Intimidation roll, his victims are so unnerved that they must exceed
	his successes on their next roll if they want to succeed.  The mutant's
	difficulty is the opponent's Willpower.

	Mega-Wits Power Stunts:
	¥ Lie Detection- the mutant is very difficult to fool.  He reduces his
	opponent's Subterfuge dice pools by his Wits score.
	¥ Size Up The Situation- by sacrificing one success from his Initiative
	roll, a mutant with this Stunt can declare his action last, regardless
	of what order he would normally speak in.
	¥¥ Pants Up- the mutant who has this Stunt is incapable of botching an
	initiative roll.  He may ignore all ones in such rolls.
	¥¥ Reaction- the mutant can never be required to give up his action due
	to surprise.
	¥¥¥ Multi-tasking- the mutant's mind is capable of several calculations
	at once without problems.  As such, the mutant can perform multiple
	actions in one round with a smaller reduction from his dice pool- the
	mutant divides the largest dice pool, rather than the smallest one.
	¥¥¥ Unflappable- all Willpower difficulties are reduced by one; the
	mutant never panics.
	¥¥¥¥ Social Edge- the mutant is immune to all Powers and stunts that
	rely on social misdirection or control, from Social Chameleon to
	Mega-Intelligence's Towering Intellect stunt to most Mega-Appearance,
	-Wits, or -Manipulation stunts.
	
	Mega-Appearance Power Stunts:
	
	Variation: Mega-Ugliness-  at the player's option, rather than being
	incredibly beautiful, the mutant can be incredibly ugly-- still
	allowing the use of Mega- Appearance stunts, but with overtones of
	horror or revulsion rather than attraction.

	¥ Ageless- the mutant's lifespan is not extended, but with this Stunt,
	he will never show it until the day he dies.  The mutant loses no
	Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, or Appearance due to the ravages of age.
	¥ Awe-Inspiring- the mutant is so beautiful as to inspire devotion and
	awe in those that behold him.  He receives one automatic success in all
	Leadership, Interrogation, and Intimidation rolls, as well as any roll
	that involves persuasion or inspiration, per Rank in Mega-Appearance.
	¥ Perfect Skin- the skin is a fundamental part of any mutant's beauty.
	Any attack that disfigures the skin (by cutting it, bruising it, or
	burning it, for instance) is less effective against the mutant.  She
	heals one Health Level of damage (so long as the attack did not kill
	her) the round after any such attack, regardless of whether it was
	bruising, lethal, or aggravated in nature.  The mutant's skin restores
	itself to its former state.  The mutant can never bleed to death.
	¥ Terrible Beauty- the mutant's Appearance is so inspiring and imposing
	that she may substitute it for Charisma in any situation that involves 
	human interaction.
	¥¥ The Total Package- the mutant's Appearance score and Mega-Appearance
	stunts can be brought to bear using another sense- be it sound, scent,
	or touch that carries the effect.  Each sense is a separate stunt.
	¥¥¥ Across Boundaries- something about the mutant's Appearance is so
	elemental that it crosses species boundaries-- even aliens will react
	to his terrible beauty.
	¥¥¥ Horror- requires the Variation: Mega-Ugliness.  The mutant may
	purchase the Power: Horror Factor with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Majesty- requires the Stunt: Terrible Beauty.  The mutant may add
	his Rank in Mega-Appearance to all social rolls, be they Appearance,
	Manipulation, or Charisma-related.
	¥¥¥¥ Aphrodite's Curse- the mutant's beauty draws the eye and confounds
	the minds of men and women alike.  Any being of the same gender as the
	mutant must score at least five successes on any social roll while in
	her presence.  Otherwise, he or she is likely to be ignored.
	
	Mega-Manipulation Power Stunts:
	¥ No Fool- the mutant subtracts his Manipulation score from the
	Subterfuge dice pools of his opponents.  In combination with the Lie
	Detection stunt, above, the mutant becomes literally impossible to
	fool.
	¥ Trickster- the mutant is capable of fooling almost anyone using a
	combination of fast talk and shrewd assessment.  The mutant receives
	an automatic success to any Subterfuge roll per Rank of Mega-
	Manipulation.
	¥¥ Obsession- the mutant can derail a victim's train of thought by
	asking a provoking question; while the mutant concentrates, her victim
	can think of nothing else.  This requires a contested Manipulation +
	Interrogation roll against the victim's Willpower.
	¥¥ Rear Guard- the mutant is always left out of any roll or other form
	of random determination when the ST or another PC is choosing a target
	for an attack-- he's rarely standing close enough to factor into any
	such equation.
	¥¥¥ Entrancing Voice- the mutant's voice is almost hypnotic.  If the
	mutant's successes on a Manipulation + Performance roll exceed the
	successes of his opponent on whatever he is attempting, then the
	mutant can prevent the opponent from acting that round- instead, he
	is entranced by the mutant's voice.  The mutant's difficulty is the
	opponent's Willpower, and the opponent's Iron Will score is subtracted
	from his successes.  This ability only works if the opponent is able
	to hear the mutant's voice, and is listening to what he is saying.
	¥¥¥ It Was My Idea- with a successful Manipulation + Expression roll
	(requiring a number of successes equal to a victim's Intelligence +
	Subterfuge), the mutant can express an appealing idea and the victim
	will never know that it was not his own.
	¥¥¥¥ Iago's Face- the mutant is immune to any form of lie detection
	or mind reading, including applications of Telepathy.  Note that he
	can still be compelled.
	
	Mega-Charisma Power Stunts:
	¥ Agitation- the mutant can work a crowd up into a frenzy by making
	an inspiring speech (Charisma + Expression, diff 6).  He can inspire
	them to do things that they would otherwise be inclined to do with
	one success, or even spur them to violent acts with multiple
	successes.  The crowd gets a Willpower check against any order that
	would get them to behave badly (diff 6)- each success negates one
	of the mutant's successes.  The effects of this usually linger for
	about an hour.
	¥ Crushing Rejection- by expressing his disapproval or dislike for
	a non-hostile subject, the mutant may increase the subject's Social
	difficulties by one for the rest of the scene.
	¥¥ Take Charge- the mutant may address a person or group of people
	(Charisma + Expression, difficulty 6 or modified by the receptivity
	of the subjects); afterward, people must make a Willpower check,
	garnering more successes than the mutant's Rank in Leadership, in
	order to make a decision without consulting her.  This lasts a scene.
	¥¥¥ Dreadful Mien- the mutant is so likeable that it is actually
	difficult to strike him or oppose him.  He can use his considerable
	charm as a weapon.  As long as the mutant does not attack his victim,
	the mutant may subtract his successes on a Charisma roll from the
	opponent's rolls to hit him or to Leadership or Expression rolls
	for actions that would directly oppose the mutant.  If the mutant
	attacks the victim, then this Stunt has no further effect.  The mutant 
	must speak to the victim for some while before he can use the Dreadful 
	Mien.
	¥¥¥ Soothe- the mutant with this Stunt is an excellent peacemaker,
	and can bring an angry mob into a calmer state.  If the mutant succeeds
	on a Charisma + Expression roll, no one who heard her speak may take
	any further violent action unless they make a successful Wits roll
	that scores more successes than the mutant.  As soon as one person
	succeeds and makes an attack, the soothing atmosphere is gone, and
	all people are once again able to take violent action.  This effect
	lasts only a scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Turn on the Charm- by expending a point of Power Charge and
	talking to a person or persons (quite literally 'turning on the charm')
	the mutant can forcibly shift their reaction to him in one direction
	or another (neutrals become mild positives, mild positives become
	staunch friends, friends become followers, hostiles become strong
	negatives become mild negatives become neutrals-- or the reverse)
	by scoring as many successes as the victim's Manipulation + Subterfuge
	score on a Charisma + Expression roll (diff varies with how strongly
	the audience feels in the first place).

	Mega-Strength/Hyper-Speed Combination Power Stunts:
	¥/¥ Pow- The mutant may add his Rank in Hyper-Speed to his damage
	pools for Brawling or Melee attacks.
	¥¥¥/¥¥¥ Bullet- with the strength of his mighty throwing arm, the
	character may propel an object at such a speed that it causes Firearms-
	type damage.  This can be embarrassing with anvils or chairs or the
	like.  Heck, he can throw a bullet if he wants.  Requires the Stunt:
	Javelin.
	
	Mega-Dexterity/Mega-Wits Combination Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥¥ Ambidexterity- the mutant may have one action per hand (or
	limb, in the case of mutants with Extra Body Parts and/or the
	Omnidexterity stunt) without splitting her dice pool; for every
	limb and action above two, another Rank of Mega-Dexterity and Mega-
	Wits is required.
	¥¥¥/¥ Razor Rebound- if the mutant has the Yadomejutsu ability, he may
	return hand-slung missiles that he catches in the same round (no action
	required) with his Yado roll serving as substitute for Dex + Missiles.
	
	Mega-Dexterity/Mega-Appearance Combination Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥ Inhuman Grace- the hero may ignore a number of 'ones' equal to her
	Rank in Mega-Appearance on any Dexterity roll involving coordination or
	grace (excluding combat).  This includes dancing, tightrope walking, and
	the like.  If Appearance is used for the roll instead of Dexterity, the
	mutant may instead ignore a number of 'ones' equal to her Rank in Mega-
	Dexterity.
	
	Mega-Appearance/Mega-Charisma Combination Power Stunts:
	¥/¥ Smile Your Way In- the mutant is an instant celebrity, whose
	opinion is sought no matter how low his intelligence.  He has a default
	Status (as per the Background) of 1 in all groups that are not inimical 
	to him.
	¥¥/¥¥ Devoted Slaves- Any baseline character whose Willpower is less
	than the total Ranks that the mutant has in Mega-Charisma and Mega-
	Appearance will become entranced to the point of slavish devotion 
	with the expenditure of a point of Power Charge.
	¥/¥¥¥ My Name is Legion- Whenever the mutant is threatened in a public
	place, all neutral onlookers must make a Willpower check (diff of her
	Charisma score) or feel compelled to come to her aid.
	
	Mega-Appearance/Physical Adaption Combination Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥/¥ Transcendent Beauty- the mutant's appearance automatically 
	shifts to reflect the cultural standard of beauty where he is, if he
	does not already match that standard.

Memory Vampirism* (Mental) [AH]
	This is not a nice Power, and mutants who use it are not nice people.
	Basically, the mutant can 'eat' one dot of a Talent, Skill, Knowledge,
	or (more easily) raw Experience Points, and convert them into a form
	that she can use.  Not socially acceptable.  The mutant must touch her
	victim, and win a contested Willpower check (diff 6) to drain the
	memories.  Every point of raw Experience or dot in an Ability is worth
	one point of Experience.  This point, if taken from an Ability, may be
	spent on that Ability if desired (without any need for further
	justification).  The mutant always starts by draining Experience
	points, and then moves up the list until she reaches her limit.
	
	¥ The mutant can drain surplus Experience points only.
	¥¥ The mutant can drain Knowledges.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can drain Skills.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can drain Power Stunts.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can drain Talents.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can drain Intelligence.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Blackouts- with a contested Manipulation + Memory Vampirism vs.
	Willpower check, the mutant can attempt to rob a person of five minutes
	of memory per success (the last five minutes with one success, the
	last 15 minutes with three successes, etc.)

Mental Disruption (Mental) [AN]
	Like Scatterbrain of the Technet (yikes!), a mutant with this Power
	can make it very difficult for people to think- and therefore, to
	act.  Unfortunately, this requires that the mutant touch someone,
	and continue to touch that person for as long as she wants the
	effect to last- though it lasts at least a round.  Still, there is 
	little that is more incapacitating than the caress of a mutant with 
	this Ability.  A simple roll to hit is all that is required for 
	this Power to function.  Any roll that requires an Attribute that
	has been reduced to zero or less by this Power automatically fails.
	Psychic Defense reduce the effective Rank of this Power by one
	per Rank in that Power.
	
	¥ Difficulties for all actions are increased by two, and the
	victim loses two effective points of Intelligence.  Telepathy,
	Telekinesis, and other Powers requiring a high degree of
	concentration are impossible.  Actions that would normally
	not require a roll are now difficulty four.
	¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by three.  Any action
	that would be increased in difficulty beyond ten cannot be
	attempted.  The mutant loses three effective points of
	Intelligence and Wits.  Actions that would normally not
	require a roll are now difficulty five.
	¥¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by four.  The victim
	loses four effective points of Intelligence, Wits, and Perception.
	Actions that would not normally require a roll are now difficulty
	six.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by five.  The
	victim loses one action automatically, and five effective points
	of Intelligence, Wits, Perception, and Willpower.  Actions that
	would not normally require a roll are now difficulty seven.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by six.  The
	victim loses two actions automatically, and six effective points
	of Intelligence, Wits, Perception, Willpower, and Dexterity.
	Actions that would not normally require a roll are now difficulty
	eight.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Frisson- the mutant, rather than gripping her victim, may 
	simply 'graze' him, which halves the effects (rounding down)
	but lasts two rounds rather than one.  This still requires a roll
	to hit.
	¥ Lack of Focus- if the victim has to abort her action because
	it is no longer possible (planning on climbing into a car that
	has since exploded, for example), she does not have the option
	of taking another action that round.
	¥¥ The Bugs- if the victim loses an action (due to botching an
	initiative roll), she continues to lose actions automatically
	until she spends a point of Willpower.
	¥¥ Shiver- the victim, while contact is continued, has one
	auto-success vs. telepathic and empathic attacks for every
	Rank the mutant has in this Power.
	¥¥¥ Memory loss- the victim loses an effective number of points
	in each Knowledge equal to (Rank - 2) Intelligence loss.  At Rank
	three, this means that the victim loses two points from each
	Knowledge.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Stack overflow- if the victim loses more points in an
	Attribute than he has, then rather than merely failing actions
	requiring those Attributes, he is considered to have botched
	them.

Mental Energy Absorption/Conversion (Mental) [AN]
	The mutant Bishop has demonstrated (upon occasion) the ability to
	absorb and convert the energy from psychic assaults.  Not only does
	this allow him to resist telepathy and psychic blasts, it allows him
	to use the energy he absorbs in this way to attack.  Any mental
	attack including anything with the word "psychic" in it that affects
	the mutant directly, or anything with the word "mental" or "mind"
	that similarly represents a direct assault, can be used by this Power.
	The mutant can also absorb (by touch) the energies used to make
	Psychic Fields, etc.  Typically, the mutant is not protected from
	the collateral effects of the Power he is trying to absorb if he
	cannot absorb it completely.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Mirrorform- the mutant absorbs energy only to re-release it in
	the same form.  A Dexterity + Directed Blast is required to hit for
	psychic blasts or bolts.
	* Energy Conversion- the mutant changes the energy into another form
	before releasing it (Bishop converts energy).  A Dexterity + Directed 
	Blast is required to hit.
	* Health Conversion- the mutant heals a Health Level of normal damage
	for every point absorbed, or a Level of aggravated damage for every
	two points.  'Overlap damage' that he does not soak is eligible to
	be healed with the energy that he did soak from the same attack.
	* Willpower Conversion- the mutant regains a point of Willpower for
	each point absorbed.

	¥ The mutant can absorb two dice of damage, or one effective Rank
	of power.
	¥¥ Three dice or two Ranks.
	¥¥¥ Four dice or three Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥ Five dice or four Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Six dice or five Ranks.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Eight dice or six Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Ten dice or seven Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Twelve dice or Eight Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Fourteen dice or Nine Ranks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen dice or Ten Ranks.

Metempsychosis/Mind Switching (Mental) [AH]
	Mind Switching, or Metempsychosis, is a fine tradition in the comics.
	It can be a source of endless amusement, or a tool of terror.  The
	average mutant who has this Power can exchange her mind for another's-
	trapping the other person's mind in her own body, while she occupies
	the other person's body.  Every now and then, there comes along a
	mutant who can exchange minds between third parties.

	Variation: Third-Party Metempsychosis- for five extra Freebie points,
	and five extra Experience points per Rank, the mutant can switch the
	bodies of third parties- she does not have to participate in the
	ritual, though she can.  If she can _only_ switch third parties, and
	not herself, then there is no Freebie or Experience cost above and
	beyond the norm.

	Special Flaw: Conduit (4 point Flaw)- This Flaw is available only for
	mutants who take the Third-Party variation of this Power.  Each time
	the mutant uses her Power to make someone switch bodies, her own
	body changes a little bit.  She loses her individuality and becomes
	every more like an 'average' person.  One point of Strength, Stamina,
	Dexterity, or Appearance is added or lost until all of these scores
	have a rating of 2.  Of course, these Attributes can still be improved
	by Experience, but they will be subject to loss with every use of
	Metempsychosis.  Even Powers like Mega-Strength are no proof against
	this Flaw.

	Note that the Powers of the body stay with the body, with the exception
	of this Power.

	The basic system involved in this Power is Perception + Metempsychosis
	(difficulty 8).  The victim gets a save (Willpower check diff 8- must
	match or beat the mutant's successes).  In addition, each party must
	make a Stamina check once the switch is complete (using the new
	body's Stamina- diff 5), or system shock will result in death.  If
	either party fails this check, the switch is permanent.

	¥ The mutant can switch minds for up to an hour at a time.  The range
	of the Power is touch.
	¥¥ The mutant can switch minds for up to an hour.  The mutant must
	touch or make eye contact with the victim to switch.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can switch minds for up to a day.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can switch minds for up to a week.  The range of the
	Power is five feet, or eye contact.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can switch minds for up to a year.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can switch minds permanently.  The range of the
	Power is line of sight.

Mind Armour (Mental) [AL]
	Not to be confused with Psychic Armour, Mind Armour holds a mutant's
	body together through sheer force of will.  Whenever the mutant
	takes a wound from any source, she can compare the damage inflicted
	to her current Willpower.  She can then ignore any wound that is
	less than her current Willpower (it inflicts no damage and has none
	of its normal collateral effects).  This costs a point of Willpower
	(which is subtracted after the comparison).  Any excess damage is
	let through- this can be soaked at a +1 difficulty.  Of course, the
	mutant can always elect to let the punishment through her Mind Armour,
	in which case it is soaked normally.  Of course, once she runs out
	of Willpower, this Power ceases to be useful.

	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can create Mind Armour to protect herself from attacks.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Bio Resistance- with this stunt, the character's Mind Armour also
	functions against all sorts of Power manipulation and Biomanipulation,
	including those which do not inflict damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Emergency Healing- the mutant may heal a Health Level of damage
	with the expenditure of a point of Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥ Invincible- while the mutant's Mind Armour is functioning, 
	telepaths and other psychic hostiles must roll a number of successes
	equal to his current Willpower to affect him.
	¥¥¥¥/¥ Iron Skin (Mind Armour/Iron Will Stunt)- the mutant can spend
	a point of Willpower to harden her skin to the equivalent Rank of
	Matter Hardening for one round.  In terms of preventing damage, this
	is a prophylactic measure.

Mind Disease (Mental) [AL]
	Unfortunately for the mutant, anyone with this Power is insane.
	Unfortunately for the world, this insanity is contagious.  The mutant
	picks one derangement at character creation.  This derangement is the
	source of his Power.  Anyone that the mutant touches becomes infected
	with this same derangement unless they succeed at a Willpower check
	(difficulty of the mutant's Willpower).  The effects last anywhere
	from a few rounds to forever, depending on the mutant's Rank.  Any new
	derangement that the mutant acquires can also be 'spread along' via 
	the Mind Disease.  If the mutant himself is cured of his derangement(s), 
	this Power becomes dormant until the day when he 'loses it' again.

	¥ Effects are continuous with touch and last for one round after the
	mutant releases the victim.
	¥¥ Effects last for ten rounds minus the victim's Willpower; minimum
	of one round.
	¥¥¥ Effects last for one scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Effects last for one day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Effects are permanent.

Necromantic Animation (Mental) [AL]
	One of the least esteemed of all Powers is the ability to raise the
	dead.  This Power does not truly restore life to a body, but instead
	attempts to simulate the mind of the once-living person and quicken
	the rotting shell.  This probably won't convince your father-in-law
	that you're a nice guy.  At any rate, the mutant can reanimate a
	corpse, giving it such memories and personality as its state of
	decomposition allows, and then control it.  The more recently dead
	the being is, the more concentration this control requires, and the
	more like the living being the corpse is.  To animate the dead
	requires a Charisma + Animation roll (diff 7).  To establish control
	(or to struggle for it) requires a Manipulation + Animation roll,
	difficulty of the corpse's Willpower.  If the being has been long
	dead, assume a Willpower of 2.  Animation requires the expenditure
	of a point of Willpower.

	¥ The mutant can control one dead person at a time.  The more
	recently dead the person is, the more of its Talents, Skills, and
	Knowledges this Power can simulate.  For every year that the
	being has been dead, subtract one point from its Willpower and
	from each of its Abilities.  Abilities that reach zero are (of
	course) lost.  The zombie has likely also lost at least one point
	from each of Dexterity, Wits, and Appearance.  Additional losses
	are possible, depending on the manner of the death, the state of
	the corpse, etc.
	¥¥ Three dead can be controlled at a time.
	¥¥¥ Five dead.
	¥¥¥¥ Seven dead.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten dead.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Shaun of the Dead- by expending a point of Willpower, the mutant 
	can temporarily restore one or more Abilities to a corpse.  One point
	of Willpower = one point in a Talent, Skill, or Knowledge that the
	corpse had in life.  This boost lasts a scene.
	¥¥ Twenty-Eight Days Later- this Stunt preserves the animated and
	less-intelligent dead indefinitely, preventing them from rotting away
	as they normally would.  No effect on free-willed undead.
	¥¥ White Zombie- if the mutant uses a 'prop' substance such as zombie
	cucumber, the animation difficulty is reduced by one.
	¥¥¥ Night of the Living Dead- the mutant may animate the corpse and
	then 'turn it loose', giving a simple goal that it will attempt to
	pursue to the best of its rather limited ability.  This only works on
	dead who have an effective Intelligence of 1; any more, and the zombie
	will rebel.  Any less, and it will collapse.  The zombie keeps moving
	until the next sunrise.
	¥¥¥ Dawn of the Dead- in addition to zombies, the mutant may also
	animate skeletons.  These are only capable of fighting, guarding, and
	carrying things.  Assume an Intelligence of zero.
	¥¥¥¥ Army of Darkness- if the mutant creates a free-willed undead (as
	per Day of the Dead, Evil Dead, or Nosferatu), it does not count
	toward the limit of how many undead can be animated at once.
	¥¥¥¥ Day of the Dead- in addition to zombies, the mutant may also
	create ghouls; these act like movie zombies (hunger for flesh, etc.)
	and if a person is killed by a ghoul without being completely devoured,
	that person shall rise as a ghoul within a few hours. Requires the
	Stunt: Night of the Living Dead.  This can get quite out of hand if the
	necromancer isn't paying attention.  Note that ghouls are typically
	free-willed, and some of them can be quite intelligent.   The low
	Intelligence requirement for the Night stunt does not apply.
	¥¥¥¥ The Evil Dead- requires the Stunt: Night of the Living Dead. The
	mutant can raise an intelligent, free-willed zombie that is dominated
	by its Shadow, as per Wraith: the Oblivion.  Basically, the zombie is
	an evil version of its living self.
	¥¥¥¥ Twenty-Eight Weeks Later- requires the Stunt: Night of the Living
	Dead.  The mutant, by touching a corpse and spending a point of Power
	Charge, can designate a 'time lapse', a period after which it will
	animate with a simple goal, as per Night of the Living Dead.  The
	mutant need not be present when it animates.  The longest time lapse
	possible is equal to one week per success on a Manipulation + Animation
	roll (diff as normal for establishing control).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Nosferatu- the mutant can create a weak, comic book-style vampire
	by spending a point of Power Charge and filling a dying person's mouth
	with blood.  The new vampire sucks blood, has enhanced Physical
	attributes (add 3 to each), is harmed by sunlight, holy water, crosses,
	etc.  It cannot learn disciplines like a true vampire, but it can
	create new vampires in the traditional fashion, and it is free-willed.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ravenous- consuming the brain of a resurrected free-willed undead
	confers its knowledge upon the mutant for one month per dot of
	intelligence (both of the mutant and of the undead).  This includes
	Knowledges and Skills, as well as personal information.

Necropathy (Mental) [AH]
	To speak with the dead and force them to speak back is not a Power to
	be taken lightly; Necropathy allows exactly this.  The mutant must find
	the person's remains (or the nearest symbolic equivalent- a grave site,
	a cremation urn, or a particularly cherished place will do in a pinch)
	and make a Charisma + Necropathy roll (difficulty of the dead person's
	Willpower + 2) to compel the person to appear.  Whether or not this
	check succeeds, the spirit has the option of appearing.  In any case,
	the dead person appears as a shadowy, ephemeral image that closely
	resembles the person as she was in life.  Once the wraith is present,
	the mutant may use the other abilities associated with Necropathy.

	¥ The mutant may attempt to compel the spirit to answer questions; the
	spirit is not required to answer truthfully, and may leave after
	responding to a number of questions equal to the successes on the
	original roll to summon her.  The roll to compel a spirit is
	Manipulation + Necropathy (diff of the spirit's Willpower + 2).  After
	these questions are answered, the mutant may not compel the spirit to
	appear again until she gains another Rank in Necropathy, though the
	spirit may always elect to appear.
	¥¥ The mutant may compel the spirit to answer questions truthfully.
	Naturally, the spirit's knowledge is usually limited to what the person
	knew in life, except in unusual cases.  The system for compelling the
	spirit and the number of questions answered remains the same.  The
	mutant may also shield his mind from invasion by hostile spirits
	(Intelligence + Necropathy, diff 6) - each success represents another
	success that the wraith or spirit must get to read his mind or possess
	him.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can pick up the spirit's emotional state and possibly
	even surface thoughts with a Perception + Necropathy roll (diff of the
	spirit's Wits + Subterfuge for emotional state, and Intelligence +
	Subterfuge for surface thoughts).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can compel the spirit to perform tasks other than
	answering questions; of course, the spirit may not be capable of much
	(see Wraith: the Oblivion for some spiritual powers).  This is a
	Manipulation + Necropathy roll (diff of the spirit's Willpower). The
	wraith is capable of resisting the performance of repellent acts by
	spending Willpower to refuse.  This ability can also be used on the
	walking dead, though at a +3 difficulty, and the undead can resist with
	a Willpower roll (diff of the mutant's Willpower).
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can actually channel the spirit, temporarily gaining
	its knowledge and any special mental (i.e., not requiring special
	physiology) abilities that it might have.  This is a resisted Willpower
	roll (diff of the opponent's Wits + Subterfuge) and control, if
	established, lasts for one hour per success.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Stir of Echoes- the mutant may purchase the Talent: Awareness with
	experience.  However, its difficulty to detect non-wraithly phenomena
	is increased by one.
	¥¥ Sleeping Shield- while asleep, the mutant's mind may be protected
	from invasion by Wraiths in the same way as when she is awake; the
	mutant simply spends a point of Gnosis or Willpower before she goes
	to bed.
	¥¥¥ Crossing Over- the mutant can see if a person is a fetter for a
	wraith on a Perception + Necropathy roll (diff 10 minus the level of
	the fetter); a general miasma of spiritual energy surrounds such a
	person. This does not reveal which spirit is bound to the person.
	¥¥¥¥ Broken Moments in Time- the medium may view a spirit's memories on
	a successful Perception + Necropathy roll (the spirit is automatically
	aware of this attempt, and rolls Willpower to resist), the difficulty
	for each roll is the opponent's Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥ The Shadow Knows- the mutant may bring a Wraith's shadow to the
	fore, putting it in command.  This requires that the mutant garnered
	five or more successes on her compulsion roll (Man + Necropathy, as
	above).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Obliviate*- by channeling a dead spirit that has been corrupted
	into a Spectre (a servant of Oblivion, see Wraith: the Oblivion), the
	medium may enter into a contest of power with it (a contested roll of
	the mutant's current Power Charge or Gnosis vs. the Spectre's current
	Angst, diff 6).  This is very dangerous.  If the mutant garners any
	successes, she may burn off one point of the spirit's Corpus (their
	Health Levels) and channel it into a highly pattern corrosive blast of
	pure Oblivion.  Each success represents two Health Levels of damage,
	which is aggravated and unsoakable.  A Dex + Directed Blast roll is
	required to hit.  In any case, if the Spectre succeeds, then he may
	elect either to escape, or to burn a point of Corpus to inflict this
	self-same damage on the mutant (no further roll required).  These
	contests may continue every round until the spirit runs out of Corpus.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Rest for the Wicked- this potent stunt requires the expenditure
	of a point of Gnosis or Willpower whenever it is invoked.  The mutant
	then enters a contest with a spirit (Charisma + Necropathy, diff 6, vs.
	Willpower + Eidolon, diff 6).  If the mutant wins the contest, the
	spirit may well enter a harrowing (see Wraith: the Oblivion).  Starting
	with his strongest fetters, the spirit must roll his fetters (one die
	per point) at a difficulty of 6.  Even one success will prevent the
	wraith's Shadow from harrowing that fetter.  The first time the wraith
	fails one of these rolls, he enters a harrowing with that fetter at
	stake.

Necrophysiology (Physical) [PN]
	Like Morbius the Living Vampire, you have achieved some semblance of
	undeath without the intervention of actual dying.  Is it science that
	has offered this curse?  Some odd quirk of your physiology?  That's up
	to you and the Storyteller to decide.  There are several variations of
	Necrophysiology, but all have some basic similarities.
	
	* Energy draining attacks, such as Nether or Darkforce, are less
	effective against you, inflicting bashing damage.
	* Only very high-energy foods (such as meat) are nourishing for you.
	* The mutant may purchase immunity to individual poisons and diseases
	as Power Stunts.
	
	Variations:
	¥¥ Vampiric Physiology- you are only nourished by blood and other
	tissue.  You may purchase any single Vampirism Power and Life Support
	with Experience-- however, the second Rank of Life Support has no
	benefit for you.  You may purchase any of the merits or flaws
	associated with the form of vampirism you choose at any time.
	¥¥ Zuvembie Physiology- you are only nourished by human tissue.  You
	may purchase Invulnerability and Life Support with Experience.
	¥¥ Ghoulish Physiology- you are only nourished by meat.  You may
	purchase Body Weaponry (Teeth), Secretions (Paralytic), and Body
	Armour with Experience.
	¥¥ Ghostly Physiology- you may purchase Mass-Shifting (Decrease) and
	Life Support with Experience.  You may not have more than one Rank of
	Appearance, unless you purchase the Mega-Appearance Power.
	
Nemesis Power** (Physical/Social/Mental) [AN]
	The ultimate Power.  If you have this Power, you can cruise, nice and
	comfy, through combat with other Awakened beings with no problems-
	provided, of course, that you can 'tread water' until your Power kicks
	in.  The Nemesis Power reacts to the aura of a particular opponent and
	temporarily 'grows' a Power or Powers to defeat that opponent.  If the
	mutant is facing a mage, she will develop Magic Resistance.  If she is
	fighting a werewolf, perhaps it will be Matter Body (Silver). A mutant
	with Telekinesis?  Either TK or Telekinetic Shadow.  It's just that
	simple.  All the mutant has to do is wait until the Power kicks in. 
	Black Tom had better hope he can kill you before you develop Plant
	Control...
	
	¥ The mutant can develop a Rank One Power to respond to a threat.
	The response will take five rounds.
	¥¥ The mutant can develop a Rank Two Power to respond to a threat.
	This response takes four rounds.
	¥¥¥ Rank three Power, three rounds.
	¥¥¥¥ Rank four Power, two rounds.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Rank five Power, one round.
	
	These Powers last for the scene.  The mutant can have one Power per
	Rank in this Power.

Nexus Body (Physical/Social/Mental) [AL]
	A mutant with a Nexus Body actually has several bodies at his
	command, but the body that he was born with is the Nexus.  The mutant
	has the ability to move from one body to another at will, bringing
	along one or more of his Powers.  The means by which the mutant
	gets his secondary bodies is a form of possession- he must find a
	body that has no mind, and 'set up shop'.  He can either make these
	'openings' himself with a Power like Possession (pretty despicable)
	or he can find one.  In any case, the mutant (if he starts the
	game with this Power) has managed to acquire one body for use with
	this Power.  If he somehow gets this Power after character creation,
	the mutant must go out and find bodies to possess.  If the mutant
	has ever possessed a body, it is marked as 'his', and becomes more
	difficult (+3) for others to possess, even when he is absent.  It
	does not matter how far away the mutant is from a body that he
	wants to possess as long as it has been marked as 'his'- otherwise,
	the range is touch.  A simple Willpower check (diff 7) is required
	to transfer between bodies.  The process itself is instantaneous.
	
	Special Background: Body
	Each point in this Background gives the mutant another body, which
	is mindless but otherwise in good condition.  The player or ST may
	decide, at the time when this Background is taken, where the bodies
	are situated, what they look like, etc.
	
	¥ The mutant, when possessing a new body, may bring one Mental or
	Social Power along from the Nexus Body.
	¥¥ Two Powers
	¥¥¥ Three Powers
	¥¥¥¥ Four Powers
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Powers
	
	Of course, if the mutant doesn't have four Powers, then achieving
	Rank four in this one won't do him much good.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Suspended Animation- the bodies, when unoccupied, fall into a
	state of suspended animation, requiring no food or water.
	¥¥ Possession Resistance- the mutant's difficulty to resist any
	possession attack are three less when he has this Power Stunt.
	¥¥ Light Sleeper- the mutant always knows when the Nexus Body is
	being threatened in some way, and can return to it as an action at
	any time.
	¥¥¥ Cellular memory- the bodies that the mutant occupies have one
	point of Talent, Skill or Knowledge per Rank.  Using these
	abilities is at a +1 difficulty.

Object Animation (Social) [AL]
	You don't want to give a mutant with this Power any breathing room.
	She has the ability to control the movements of material objects,
	particularly ones that have been created or shaped by a sentient
	creature. Cars, pencils, robots, and strips of cellophane all fall
	into this category.  In any case, this Power is a combination of
	Matter Control and Telekinesis, except that rather than reshaping
	the material, the mutant merely moves it in ways that it was meant
	to move.  For example, a mutant may turn on a car's ignition and
	drive it about, flex and move a piece of paper, or any like action.

	In the case of malleable objects, the mutant affects their movement
	and shape with her Manipulation score, treating it as the equivalent
	of Strength for the purpose.  (Thus, a mutant with this Power and a
	Manipulation of 3 might move about an object weighing roughly 250
	pounds with ease).  An object's moving parts are acted upon with the
	object's own effective Strength score.
	
	This Power does not usually give objects the ability to fly unless
	they already had it.  The object must be within the mutant's clear
	perceptual range (typically, this means vision).
	
	If the object has moving parts, and the mutant's Technology score
	is sufficient to understand the workings of it, the difficulty to
	affect it is 6.  If it does not have moving parts, the diff is 7.
	If the object is too sophisticated for the mutant to understand,
	she must garner multiple successes to achieve the desired effect
	(discretion of the ST).  The system for this Power is Manipulation
	+ Object Animation.  To attack with an object is a Perception +
	Object Animation roll (diff 7).
	
	¥ One simple object or up to two moving parts may be moved at a
	time; the range of this Power is 20 feet.
	¥¥ Two simple objects or three moving parts; 40 feet.
	¥¥¥ Four simple objects or six moving parts; 100 feet.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight simple objects or ten moving parts; 200 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Nine simple objects or eighteen moving parts; 500 feet.

Object Disintegration (Mental) [AH]
	As with Telekinesis, Cryokinesis, and other such powers, Object
	Disintegration allows direct manipulation of matter through the force
	of will.  In this case, the mutant can affect molecular and ionic
	bonds, teasing them apart.  This requires a great deal of concentration
	and visualization on the part of the power holder.  Bonds are slowly
	attenuated over a matter of rounds until they pass an 'event horizon',
	and sudden dissolution occurs.
	
	The player rolls Intelligence + Object Disintegration, with a standard
	difficulty of 7 (for chemically homogeneous objects).  It takes one
	round per Health Level that the object has, minus one round per success
	that the mutant rolled (minimum of two rounds), for disintegration to
	take place.
	
	More complex objects (more heterogeneous ones) are tricky.  Something
	like a car (a combination of plastics, metals, rubber, glass, perhaps
	leather) would be difficulty 8, at least.  Most living things are
	hideously complex; a human or dog would likely be difficulty 10 to
	disintegrate.
	
	If the mutant's concentration is disrupted before the disintegration
	takes place, the release of energy inside the object still delivers
	one Health Level of damage per success plus one Health Level per round
	that the mutant was able to concentrate before he was interrupted.

	The difficulty to soak this effect is seven.  Only living creatures
	and 'special' materials (ST option) get a soak roll.  So long as the
	object maintains one Health Level, it retains its shape, but it is
	structurally weakened and chemically unstable.
	
	Adamantium and like 'indestructible' materials should be granted a
	hefty number of Health Levels to simulate the incredible strength of
	their chemical bonds.
	
	¥ The mutant's range is touch.  This can be inconvenient.
	¥¥ A range of 5 metres, and line of sight.
	¥¥¥ The mutant must maintain line of sight.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can be up to 50 metres away, and only needs to see
	the target at first to establish contact.
	¥¥¥¥¥ So long as the mutant has a sense that can directly distinguish
	the object and place it in a spatial context, he can be any distance
	away.

Object Incarnation (Mental) [AH]
	Similar to Psychic Impressions, this Power allows the mutant to tap
	into the spirit of an object. Rather than experiencing memories and
	sensations from the object, she gains access to Abilities related to
	it.  A sword, for example, would provide points in Melee. 

	Objects with a long history are more powerful than newer or generic
	items.  A cavalry sabre from the Civil War, or a katana used during the
	Meiji Revolution, would grant a higher score than one purchased through
	a mail order catalog yesterday.  They would also likely provide
	additional skills; usually these skills are ones that were possessed by
	the user.  However, they must be Abilities that might conceivably be
	related to the object.  An ancient king's sword might impart Leadership
	or similar skills, but something like cooking is right out.  Since this
	Power taps into the object's spirit, what you see isn't always what you
	get.  The Stetson of Indiana Jones was worn by the actor Harrison Ford;
	but the spirit it imparted would be that of Indiana Jones. 

	At the Storyteller's discretion, objects with very strong spirits might
	overwhelm the mutant; causing her to temporarily take on personality
	traits associated with it.  The above-mentioned hat, while it might
	impart points in whip use, history and archeology, would also likely
	leave the mutant with a desire to find ancient relics and fight Nazis.
	When these situations occur, it is a Willpower roll (diff. 7) to
	resist.
	
	¥¥ The mutant is capable of tapping into the spirit of an object.
	Perception + Object Incarnation (diff. 7).  This lasts for one scene,
	or until the mutant loses physical contact with the object.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Psychic Impressions: The mutant may purchase the Power: Psychic
	Impressions with experience.
	
	Object Incarnation/Psychic Impressions Stunts:
	¥¥ Shadow Life: The mutant may purchase a variant of the Power: Past
	Lives with experience. This variant works the same as normal, with one
	exception: the mutant does not receive any "free" past lives. Instead,
	the available slots must be filled using the Stunt: Record Anima.
	¥¥ Record Anima: Requires the Stunt: Shadow Life, and the variant
	Power: Past Lives. Some objects contain particularly powerful spirits
	and memories. A mutant with this stunt is capable of gaining complete
	access to them. This costs 3 experience and 1 Willpower, and requires a
	Willpower roll (diff. 7). If the mutant fails, the Willpower is wasted,
	but the experience is not spent. On a botch, the mutant loses an extra
	point of Willpower, along with the experience. If the roll succeeds,
	the mutant may incorporate the strongest of the impressions from the
	object into one of his Past Life slots.

Occlusion* (Mental) [AL]
	Also sometimes referred to as Spirit of Failure, this Power numbs the
	instrumental memory of its victims, such that they forget how to do
	things, or at least forget how to do them well.  It manifests as a
	light fog of confusion or disability that settles over the mind,
	making any action more difficult to accomplish.  The mutant may pick
	one victim, or any number of victims within a certain area.  He may
	only single them out using line-of-sight, though... if he wants to
	exclude a single person from an area of effect, he must keep an eye
	on her.  The system for this Power is an Intelligence + Occlusion
	roll (diff 6); it is resisted by the victims with a Wits + Psychic
	Defense (or other power providing a psi-screen), diff 6.
	
	¥ All Skills rolls are increased in difficulty by one.
	¥¥ All Skills and Talents rolls are increased in difficulty by two.
	¥¥¥ All Skills, Talents, and Knowledge rolls are at +2 difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥ All rolls featuring Abilities or Perception are at +3 
	difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ All rolls featuring Abilities, Perception, or Dexterity are at
	+3 difficulty.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ All rolls using an Ability, Perception, Dexterity, or 
	Intelligence are at +3 difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ All such rolls are at +4 difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ All of the above plus rolls related to Backgrounds are at
	a +4 difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ All of the above plus rolls related to Power Stunts are at
	a +4 difficulty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ All such rolls are at +5 difficulty.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ He who hesitates- By concentrating on dulling reaction (this Power
	has no other effect this round) the mutant may cause the person who
	has the worst initiative roll to lose his turn.
	¥¥ Errors accumulate- if a victim botches a roll, the mutant may
	concentrate each round, automatically bestowing the same number of
	'ones' on each and every roll until the victim gets the monkey off
	her back by succeeding despite the handicap.
	¥¥¥ Missed opportunity- Victims may no longer re-roll 'tens'.
	¥¥¥ Strangled rage- the mutant may sabotage people with Rage, taking
	away their ability to spend Rage or frenzy with the expenditure of
	a point of Power Charge.  This lasts for a scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Nothing is certain- All automatic successes that the victim is
	entitled to are cancelled, except for expended Willpower, when the
	mutant concentrates.
	¥¥¥¥¥ No concentration- the mutant may remove one person's ability 
	to spend Willpower for automatic successes for a scene with the
	expenditure of a point of Power Charge.

Oracular Travel (Mental) [AN]
	This Power is a peculiar combination of Precognition and Probability
	Manipulation.  It is rarely used by those who possess it, because
	Oracular Travel can get you into a lot of trouble.  In essence, the
	mutant decides to find the source of a particular problem or the
	answer to a certain question.  He must have a question in mind to
	use the Power voluntarily.  Then, he steps outside and heads on his
	way, and the Power nudges him (and others) to where he needs to be
	to find out what he wants to know.  It's just that simple.  This
	destination does not have to be a place that will reveal all at the
	click of a button- thinking will still be required in most cases-
	but the legwork will be done.  The main source of the problem with
	this Power is that it tends to kick in when the mutant is troubled
	by something, even if he doesn't realize that his Power is at work...
	No roll is required (usually) to start this power going.
	
	¥ The mutant will head in the right direction, and get little 'urges'
	that tell him what to do next, but that's about it.  The Power cuts
	out as soon as he arrives at his destination.
	¥¥ As Rank one, but the mutant can also 'call in' someone he knows
	(wherever they are) to help out.  This is a Charisma + Oracular
	Travel roll, difficulty depending on the identity of the person
	that you're calling in.  If she is close to you physically, is
	family or friend, and would want to help you out if she knew your
	dilemma... low difficulty (5).  If the person's in Bangladesh,
	has never heard of you, and wouldn't care if he had... higher
	difficulty (10).
	¥¥¥ As Rank two, but a few happy coincidences may occur to smooth
	the way to the destination (a passenger on the plane you need to
	catch gets sick and cancels, a cabby takes a wrong turn and sees
	you standing there, etc.).  This does not always happen, by any
	means.
	¥¥¥¥ As Rank three, but the mutant can 'call in' as many as three
	people to help him out, with reduced difficulty (-2).  These
	folks must make a Willpower check (diff 6) or feel compelled to
	render what (non-life or bank account-threatening) aid they can.
	This will never affect villainous henchmen or the like.
	¥¥¥¥¥ As Rank four, but the mutant can also temporarily call on
	a sort of Arcane for the duration of the Travel (until he gets
	to his destination).  With concentration, all Stealth difficulties
	are reduced by two.  This is very taxing, and can only be kept
	up for a number of minutes equal to the mutant's Stamina score
	before he must rest (or at least, not call upon this Arcane) for
	an hour.

Orchard (Physical) [PN]
	This rather revolting Power changes the mutant's body to such an
	extent that he begins to sprout small 'fruit' (frequently from the
	back and shoulders) which, when consumed, have various effects (chosen
	at character creation).  Frequently, they have some sort of narcotic
	effect.  These fruit grow at a fixed rate (which may be accelerated in
	combination with such Powers as Healing Factor), and in fixed numbers.
	No roll is required.  There is often a more potent effect if the juice
	of the fruit is distilled.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Clear Thought- decrease difficulty for all Intelligence actions by
	one for one hour.
	* Euphoria- reduce all dice penalties by one, increase all difficulties
	for Mental actions (dice pools including Intelligence, Perception, or
	Wits) by one.  Lasts an hour per Rank.
	* Fearless- the imbiber is immune to fear for an hour.
	* Focus- add two dice to all dice pools, but consumer cannot split
	dice pools.  Lasts one hour.
	* Hallucination- induces paranoid hallucinations in the imbiber for one
	hour/Rank if the consumer's Stamina does not exceed the mutant's Rank
	in this Power.
	* Paralysis- fruit causes stiffness, decreasing the imbiber's Dexterity
	score by its Rank.  If Dexterity reaches zero, the consumer cannot move.
	This lasts an hour.
	* Power Charge- this fruit allows the imbiber to trade one point of
	Willpower for a point of Power Charge, as its numbing, narcotic effect
	awakens her mutant energy.
	* Power Dampening- acts as the equivalent Rank of Power Dampening for
	one hour per Rank.
	* Samson- consumer gains one point of Strength per Rank for an hour;
	however, all actions involving Dexterity are at +1 difficulty.
	* Vigor- restore one Health Level of aggravated damage, or two Health
	Levels of lethal damage.  No effect on bashing damage.  Must make a
	Stamina check (diff 6, at a cumulative +2 difficulty per fruit) to
	keep it down.
	
	¥ The mutant grows up to two fruit at a time; these take three days to
	mature, and will last indefinitely 'on the vine', or for one day if
	removed (indefinitely if pressed and distilled).  Distilling takes two
	days, and doubles the duration (if no duration, then doubles the
	effect).
	¥¥ Four fruit at a time
	¥¥¥ Six fruit at a time
	¥¥¥¥ Eight fruit at a time
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten fruit at a time
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Aroma- with three hours of concentration (enough time for a new fruit
	to bud), the mutant can change the smell of the new fruit.
	¥¥¥ Fascination- requires the Stunt: Aroma.  The scent of the fruit is
	so appealing that people who see it (or its juice) must make a Willpower
	check to avoid trying one.

Organic Invention (Physical/Mental) [AH]
	A powerful ability which allows the mutant to create organic
	technology.  This is accomplished by taking some of his own body mass
	and absorbing ambient molecules- these are forged together by the
	force of the mutant's will.  Creating such devices costs one Health
	Level for each pound that the device will weigh, but the cost is worth
	it.  The possible uses for this Power are limited only by the mutant's
	invention skills (high levels of Science, Technology, and Biology are
	a good idea)- any device that could be created with normal technology
	can be created with Organic Invention.

	There are two major advantages to this Power; firstly, the cost of
	creating the device is one Rank less than it would be otherwise (for
	the purposes of Resources).  Second, the devices created in this way
	are actually living creatures.  They need air, water, food, and rest. 
	However, they are actually self- healing (usually at a normal human
	rate, unless the mutant has the Power: Hyper-Invention), and it may be
	possible that they can reproduce!

	Naturally, these devices are not normally intelligent, but in some
	cases they can be made so... A variety of rolls is required to create
	an organic invention- all of the rolls required for invention
	(typically Science, Technology, Research, and Surgery rolls) and also
	certain Biology, Medicine, and even Animal Ken rolls.

	¥ The devices have a maximum of one Stamina and one Health Level.
	¥¥ Two Stamina and three Health Levels.
	¥¥¥ Three Stamina and four Health Levels.  Reproduction is
	possible.
	¥¥¥¥ Four Stamina and six Health Levels.  Systems such as
	hibernation are possible.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Stamina and seven Health Levels.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Bioarchitect's Sight- the mutant may purchase the Power:
	Bioarchitect's Sight with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Hyper-Invention- you may purchase the Power: Hyper-Invention
	with Experience.

Ossification (Physical) [AL]
	A curious ability, to be sure, this is the ability to promote bone
	growth in yourself and others.  Furthermore, the mutant who has this
	power can 'shape' bones, at least while they are growing under the
	influence of this Power, into whatever configurations he desires.
	Thus, it can be used to make temporary Body Weaponry or even Body
	Armour, or to inflict damage upon others by attacking their insides
	with their own bones (yucky!).  Marrow has a variation of this Power,
	which supplies her with bone knives.  A supply of calcium and other
	essential elements is required.  Note that Bone Body Armour is not
	designed to allow cellular respiration, and the character will soon
	be very sick if she does not banish or 'shed' it.  A Stamina +
	Ossification roll (difficulty 7) is usually the rule.
	
	¥ Heal broken bones, etc. in the space of one round.  This can fix
	up to three Health Levels of damage, depending on the nature of the
	mutant's injuries.
	¥¥ Shape bone slowly as it grows, to create a thicker skull, longer
	legs, bone finger claws, etc.  Increase the density of bone to the
	point where all blunt-force attacks can be soaked at -1 difficulty.
	A botch can inflict up to 3 Health Levels of damage on the subject.
	¥¥¥ Shape bone quickly.  Rate of growth is high- creating a bone
	knife would take three rounds, for instance.  An exoskeleton of bone
	can be grown which will add 1 soak die per Rank.  Attacks with this
	power can inflict one Health Level per round on a subject (diff 8 to
	soak) with concentration.
	¥¥¥¥ Shape bone quickly and easily.  Change the chemical composition
	of the new bone, if desired (want magnesium-based bones instead of
	calcium-based ones?).  This Power, when used aggressively, can inflict
	two Health Levels per round with concentration.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Can grow body armour or a dense bone sword, etc., in a single
	round.  Used aggressively, this Power inflicts three Health levels
	of damage per round.

Pain Absorption and Conversion (Social) [AL]
	This power is not quite as nasty as it sounds.  The mutant 'eats' the
	pain of others (expressed in dice penalties) in order to empower
	himself.  This can certainly have a beneficial effect, but can also
	lead enemies into a false sense of security.  It can also encourage
	the mutant to inflict pain.  In combination with Biomanipulation, this
	is a very evil Power.  He will probably never suffer from Wound level
	dice penalties.  This pain absorbed is gone for the rest of the scene
	or until the person suffers another Health Level of damage.  A
	Wits + Pain A/C roll (diff 4 for self, diff 7 for others) is required.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Dice Bonuses- the mutant can add the dice penalties absorbed to any
	and all dice pools for one round.
	* Healing- the mutant gets a Health Level restored for every die
	absorbed.  This includes his own(!) which makes him difficult to
	kill.
	* Rage- if the mutant has that Power, he gets a point of Rage for
	every die 'eaten'.
	* Strength- the mutant gets one dot of Strength for every die 'eaten'
	up to a maximum equivalent to his Rank.

	¥ The mutant must be touching the person to absorb the pain.
	¥¥ The mutant must be touching the person, or have inflicted
	the pain and be within line of sight to absorb the dice.
	¥¥¥ The mutant must be within ten feet of the person.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be within line of sight or have inflicted the
	pain to absorb the dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be within a mile to absorb the pain.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Blood is Like Wine- if the mutant consumes a substance symbolic of
	the pain (like blood, pus, ichor, etc.) the mutant absorbs double the
	bonus.
	¥¥ Unconscious All The Time- a person at Crippled (-5) must make a
	Stamina check to avoid losing consciousness if the mutant takes his
	pain.

Pain Immunity (Physical) [AN]
	The mutant who possesses this Power probably understands it as both
	a blessing and a curse.  Although she has normal perceptual acuity
	in most respects with regard to the sense of touch, she is completely
	immune to pain of all sorts- she takes no dice penalties from being
	wounded.  This is fine in combat- sort of- but diseases and other
	complaints tend to sneak up on a mutant with this Power.  There
	is no roll required in any normal circumstance, but if there were
	it would be Stamina + Pain Immunity.  A higher Rank in this Power
	indicates more practice in operating with badly mashed body parts-
	it is hard to walk with jellied legs.
	
	¥ The mutant's dice penalties are reduced by one.
	¥¥ Dice penalties are reduced by two.
	¥¥¥ Dice penalties are reduced by three.
	¥¥¥¥ Dice penalties are reduced by four.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Dice penalties are reduced by five.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant takes no dice penalties.  In addition, the
	mutant may purchase the Power: Extra Health Levels, if she is
	not already eligible to do so.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant cannot be Incapacitated.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Electrical resistance- Fewer nerves to transmit that electricity--
	or natural over-current dampening; either way, you may purchase the
	Power: Energy Resistance (Electricity) with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Beatdown- bashing damage is meaningless to you; you are completely
	immune to it.

Parasitic Bond (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	This is another really disgusting Power that occasionally comes in
	useful.  Essentially, the mutant is harboring parasites of some kind,
	whether they are insects or worms or what-have-you.  They exist in a
	symbiotic relationship with the mutant, for they usually do not feed
	on him.  Rather, he takes them to food sources and tells them where
	to chow down.  He gets an efficient means of attacking his enemies;
	they get fed.  You probably don't want to mention this Power to
	prospective in-laws.  After being ordered to attack, the parasites
	must rest for a number of rounds equal to the rank of the Power
	before being called to eat again.  Fewer parasites respond with
	each call in a scene (they're full!) and thus the Power's effects
	go down by one Rank for each assault.  Make a Charisma + Parasitic
	Bond to send them off for lunch.  (diff 7)
	
	Variation: Techno-Organic Parasites*- T/O parasites do not need to
	feed on others, they'll just do it when you ask them to.  They can
	feed on metal as well as flesh.
	
	Variation: Air-borne Parasites- for 2 Extra Freebie points per Rank,
	the parasites have little wings, and are therefore much harder for
	your opponents to avoid.
	
	¥ The mutant's parasites are slow and sluggish to respond, and many
	of them don't answer his telepathic prompting at all.  Only enough
	respond to inflict two Health Levels of chewing damage against any
	enemy that can be chewed.  They need to be fed every day (actually,
	every week, but you need to do it daily because so many of them
	ignore your call) or they will inflict two Health Levels of damage
	on the mutant, instead!
	¥¥ The parasites pay closer attention.  More of them will spring to
	the attack when a food source is identified, inflicting two Health
	Levels of chewing damage per round for each of two rounds.  They
	need to be fed every three days or they will inflict three Health
	Levels of damage on the mutant, instead!
	¥¥¥ Most of the parasites swarm to the attack- this can even obscure
	vision, if they are capable of flight.  They will eat voraciously,
	inflicting three Health Levels of damage per round for each of two
	rounds.  They need to be fed every three days or they will inflict
	four Health Levels of damage on the mutant, instead!
	¥¥¥¥ The parasites immediately leap up to feast upon your command.
	They will devour every scrap of flesh they can get their mandibles
	on, inflicting three Health Levels of damage per round for each of
	three rounds.  They need to be fed every week or they will inflict
	five Health Levels of damage on the mutant, instead!
	¥¥¥¥¥ The parasites never cease in their hunger, and almost seem
	to anticipate your telepathic command.  They are absolutely
	relentless in their assault, eating four Health Levels of flesh
	away per round for each of three rounds.  They need to be fed
	every week or they will inflict six Health Levels of damage on
	the mutant, instead!
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Run and Hide!- the parasites will scatter and hide in the mutant's
	hair, clothing, and even (yech!) ears when the mutant asks them to.
	Charisma + Parasitic Bond (diff 6).
	¥¥ Burrowing- the parasites are expert at penetrating gaps and weak
	points in armour, ignoring extra soak dice, auto-soak, and extra Health
	Levels for Body Armour or Blood Armour.
	¥¥¥ Infestation- the mutant can order some of his parasites to take
	on a new 'carrier', exacting their toll on that hapless fellow at
	the end of each feeding period.  Charisma + Parasitic Bond (diff 8).

Passive Empathy (Mental) [AN]
	This Power allows the mutant to detect (and read) the emotions of the
	people around her.  This is not as versatile as Telepathy, but requires
	so little attention and concentration that the payoff is worth the
	difference.  The mutant automatically reduces the difficulty of all
	social rolls in non-hostile situations by her Rank (minimum difficulty
	of two).  This Power can also be used to 'fuel' such Powers as Empathic
	Energy Absorption/Conversion, since the mutant will no longer be forced
	to rely on ambient empathic energy.  No roll is required.

	¥ Detect emotions over an area equal to 20 feet.
	¥¥ Same deal, but the area is extended to a 100-foot radius.
	¥¥¥ Half-mile radius.
	¥¥¥¥ 5-mile radius.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 30-mile radius.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Direction Sense- By reading the emotional state of someone within
	range, the mutant can recognize them (if read before) and determine
	their approximate location.  Perception + Empathy.
	¥¥¥ Emotion Link- Requires the Direction Sense Stunt.  The mutant can
	'link up' with people who she is very familiar with, at the next
	highest range category, determining everything that she would get from
	Direction Sense.  If she is strongly attached to that person (bonds of
	love or hatred- the key is the strength of the emotion), the range is
	effectively unlimited.  Perception + Empathy to 'feel' the person, and
	then Charisma + Proj. Empathy to set up the link.
	¥¥¥ Expansion- the mutant may purchase any other Empathic Power with
	Experience.
	¥¥¥ Psychic Link- Requires the Emotion Link Power Stunt.  The mutant
	can set up a full-blown permanent Psychic Link with someone she loves
	(since it requires a strong mutual emotional bond and consent), or
	rarely, someone she hates.  In essence, she purchases the Psychic Link
	Power with Experience points. If the other party does not have
	sufficient Experience points to make the purchase, the mutant may pay
	the price for her as well.

Past Lives (Social) [PL]
	Everyone has had past lives (stop snickering!), but a mutant with this
	Power can actually communicate with his previous incarnations, and
	even remember some details from their lifetimes.  This works something
	like the equivalent background in Werewolf: the Apocalypse.  The
	mutant Twilight of the Archons has this Power.  Calling up a Past Life
	requires a Charisma + Past Life roll, difficulty 8.
	
	¥ The mutant can communicate with one of his past lives, which will
	either appear to him as a wraithly being (indetectible to all but the
	most perceptive and spiritual of his companions) or simply carry on a
	dialogue in the mutant's head.  In any case, the mutant can learn
	things from his prior incarnation, and can use his incarnation's scores
	in any Skill or Knowledge if they are superior to his own.
	¥¥ The mutant can communicate with two of his past lives (though not
	at the same time).
	¥¥¥ Four past lives
	¥¥¥¥ Eight past lives
	¥¥¥¥¥ Twelve past lives
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Alter Ego- the mutant can purchase the Power: Alter Ego with 
	Experience.  His new personalities are, of course, his past lives.
	These ancestors can use his Powers (and possibly any mental Powers
	that they may have had).

Persuasion (Social/Mental) [AL]
	Like some applications of Mind magick or simple Manipulation, this is
	the Power to get people to do what you want them to.  Gambit seems to
	have this Power.  It is more insidious than a brute-force tactic like
	Telekinesis or Voice of Command, and much more difficult to detect.
	Persuasion, unlike Telepathy, requires that the mutant speak for it to
	work, and Psychic Defenses are of minimal help (diff. 9 to resist)
	though they do alert the victim that Persuasion is being used on
	him/her.  Fortunately for its potential victims, this power can be
	resisted if the person targeted knows that the mutant has it.  A good
	argument on the part of the persuader, or a proposition that is
	particularly seductive to the listener, may result in bonus dice; a
	feeble or poorly-received one may result in dice penalties.  The victim
	must understand the mutant's language for this Power to work. 
	
	¥ The mutant must be touching the person to Persuade them of anything;
	the victim must like or be neutral to the mutant for the Power to work.
	Roll Manipulation + Persuasion, diff 8.
	¥¥ The mutant must maintain eye contact to Persuade someone; the victim
	must be at least neutral to the mutant for the Power to work.  Diff 8.
	¥¥¥ The mutant must be seen by the victim to Persuade her; the victim
	may be cautious or wary but not hostile.  Diff 8 to wary listeners,
	diff 7 to friendly or neutral listeners.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be within hearing range of the victim and have her
	voice recognized to Persuade anyone (or be seen).  The victim may be
	hostile to the mutant but cannot hate her.  Diff 9 to the hostile,
	diff 8 to wary, diff 7 to friendly or neutral.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant must be heard to Persuade anyone.  The victim may be
	hostile to the mutant but cannot hate her.  Diff 9 to the hostile,
	diff 7 to the wary, diff 6 to friendly or neutral listeners.

Phasing Aisle (Social) [AL]
	An invisible aisle extends from the mutant's body, allowing him to
	walk through any non-living material, passing through it without a
	trace.  If his friends snuggle in close enough, they can come along,
	too.  A Charisma + Phasing Aisle roll is required to activate the
	Power, which can be maintained with light concentration.  This Power
	does not differentiate between the softest or hardest materials,
	except that it does not phase through gases.  It provides excellent
	protection from most weapon attacks, but no protection from energy
	attacks.  Note that living creatures cannot be phased through, and can
	attack the mutant normally.  Note also that unless the mutant has the
	background: Attunement, he'll tend to leave his clothing and equipment
	behind...
	
	¥ The aisle covers the mutant from head to toe, though it does not
	phase out the very bottom edge of the mutant's body (so that he can
	walk, crawl, etc.)
	¥¥ The aisle extends three inches above the mutant, and two feet
	behind.
	¥¥¥ The aisle extends two feet ahead, six inches above, and four feet
	behind.
	¥¥¥¥ Four feet ahead, one foot above, eight feet behind.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five feet ahead, two feet above, twelve feet behind.

Photographic Reflexes (Physical) [AL]
	This ability, possessed by a handful of people, is one of the deadlier
	physical powers out there- at least when used against other physical
	characters.  The mutant can watch a person fight for seven rounds minus
	his score in this Power.  After that, the mutant can perform every
	basic combat move and trick that the person he watched is capable of. 
	It's that simple.  Any combat maneuver has only to be watched once to
	be assimilated; however, the mutant can be surprised with a combat move
	he hasn't seen before by someone he thought he'd fully assimilated. 
	Only once, though.  A simple Perception + Photographic Reflexes is
	required (diff of the victim's Dexterity + Brawl or Dex + Dodge or what
	have you); this roll can be made any number of times until it succeeds. 
	
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant gains the Melee, Dodge, and Brawl scores of the
	opposing character, if they are higher than his own. 
	Additionally, the mutant is at -3 difficulty to dodge any attack
	and to launch any attack against that enemy- at least until he or
	she gains one point in Melee, Dodge, or Brawl.  Any Combat move in
	WOD Combat can be learned in this way. Additionally, the character
	may copy any Firearms, Archery, Acrobatics, Athletics, or Missiles
	skill that he sees in use.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Same as above, only -5 difficulty.  Minimum diff of 2.  The
	character may also duplicate Stealth, Fine Control, Riding,
	Torture, or other skills that have a strong physical component to
	them, if he sees them in use.  She also gets an automatic Dodge
	roll (not requiring any actions) against all the attacks of the
	assimilated character unless fueled by Rage.  Martial Arts may be
	learned by watching at this level.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Imitation- the mutant can pick up a person's physical mannerisms
	very easily, and is at -1 difficulty to impersonate anyone (assuming
	the disguise is passable).  Perception + Photographic Reflexes,
	diff 6.
	¥¥¥¥ Sucker Punch- this stunt allows the mutant to take a hit from a
	character for reduced damage (diff 5 to soak) in order to sucker that
	character into taking a harsher hit.  After the mutant takes the hit
	(he cannot dodge it) his next attack that round with have one automatic
	success either to hit or to damage for every success on a Power roll.
	This stunt fails automatically against a character with Combat Sense
	or Combat Telepathy.
	¥¥¥¥ Directed Dodge- the mutant can also predict the frequency, height,
	and direction of an enemy's Directed Blasts, and gets the standard
	bonuses to dodge them.
	¥¥¥¥ Combat Sense- a character who purchases this Power Stunt may
	purchase the Combat Sense power with experience, even if he did not
	start the game with that power.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Orchestrate- The mutant, having assimilated two opponents, can
	lead them into falling afoul of each other in combat.  Any botched
	attack or dodge by a character being Orchestrated will run into the
	other character.  A Wits + Photographic Reflexes roll, if it comes
	up with more successes than the Wits + Brawl rolls of the targets,
	will also cause them to run afoul of each other.

Physical Adaption (Physical) [AN]
	A curious variation on the Life Support and Healing Factor powers,
	Physical Adaption actually allows the mutant's body to change to
	suit its environment.  These can be slow, gradual changes or radical
	changes in a short period of time, depending on the Power Rank and
	the demands of the situation.  This power is involuntary, and it
	would be weird improving it with experience without a good reason.
	Wolverine has a weak version of this power.  A Stamina + Physical
	Adaption roll may be required under certain circumstances.
	
	¥ The mutant can grow hard fingernails, more hair, darker skin, more
	body fat, etc. over a period of a round in order to adapt to a new
	place- nothing radical.  More efficient body parts, new internal organs
	(to filter toxins, etc.), and changes in existing organs (eyes become
	accustomed to low light or can perceive microwaves) are possible over a
	day.
	¥¥ Efficiency changes as above are possible in a number of hours; in
	addition, more radical changes such as a shift to cold blood (to lessen
	the need for food) or a change in the shape of the brain in order to
	increase memory capacity, can occur in about a day.
	¥¥¥ Efficiency changes occur in a round; more radical changes take only
	a few hours.  In addition, sweeping changes (e.g., the mutant's body
	can adjust to formerly toxic atmospheres (breathe methane instead of
	oxygen), new sorts of sensory data (new sense organs can evolve), the
	mutant can grow scaly armour or new legs) can evolve over the course of
	a day.
	¥¥¥¥ More radical changes occur in a round, and sweeping changes may
	happen in a few hours.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Any of the above changes, but reaction time is reduced to a single
	round.  Works like involuntary shapechanging.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can make minor changes voluntarily.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Efficiency changes are voluntary.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ More radical changes are voluntary.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Sweeping changes are voluntary.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Changes are instantaneous; at a Rank 10 level, this Power
	is Passive.
	
	Any one change (shift to cold blood, gill growth, etc.) can be taken as
	a power stunt to initiate voluntarily (if the mutant does not have the
	appropriate Rank), though the time frame is the same.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Take the True Form- the mutant can actively concentrate and return
	to his natural form in about the same time-frame as the power normally
	requires to function.
	¥¥¥ Chromosome shift- the mutant can shift sex (female to male to
	hermaphrodite to neuter) as an action.

Physical Disruption (Mental) [AH]
	Related to Mental Disruption, this Power damages the opponent's muscle
	control and coordination for as long as the mutant is able to maintain
	physical contact.  A simple roll to hit is all that is required for
	this Power to function, and it lasts one round, or for as long as
	contact is maintained.  Any roll that requires an Attribute that has
	been reduced to zero or less by this Power automatically fails. Psychic
	Defense reduces the effective Rank of this Power by one per Rank in
	that Power.  No roll is required, but the mutant is considered to be
	in a state of high concentration when he uses this Power.
	
	¥ Difficulties for all physical actions are increased by two, and the
	victim loses two effective points of Dexterity.  Body Part Forging,
	Dispersion, and other Physical Powers requiring a high degree of
	concentration are impossible.  Actions that would normally not require
	a roll are now difficulty four.
	¥¥ Difficulties for all physical actions increase by three.  Any action
	that would be increased in difficulty beyond ten cannot be attempted. 
	The mutant loses three effective points of Dexterity and Strength. 
	Actions that would normally not require a roll are now difficulty five.
	¥¥¥ Difficulties for all physical actions increase by four.  The victim
	loses four effective points of Dexterity and Strength.  Actions that
	would not normally require a roll are now difficulty six.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by four.  The victim loses
	one auto-success on any physical action automatically, and five
	effective points of Dexterity, Strength, and Perception.  Actions that
	would not normally require a roll are now difficulty seven.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulties for all actions increase by five.  The victim loses
	two auto-successes on any physical action automatically, and six
	effective points of Dexterity, Strength, Perception, and Wits. Actions
	that would not normally require a roll are now difficulty eight.

Physical Gestalt (Physical) [PL]
	One of the most bizarre Powers out there, it is nevertheless possessed
	by the younger sisters St. Croix (who formed M and Penance) and the
	old JLA veteran, Firestorm.  It is the ability to combine two people
	(or more!) into a single, hybrid form which may well be greater than
	the sum of its parts.  The new hybrid may have all of its component
	minds, or a single mind which may not closely resemble that of its
	'parents'- this is the player's option when this Power is chosen.  At
	any rate, these are the effects of any such gestalt:
	
	* The hybrid form has the best Physical Attributes of its components-
	so a hybrid of Wolverine and Spider-man would have Wolvie's Stamina
	with Spidey's Strength and Dexterity.
	* The Appearance of the hybrid is frequently (but not always) a mix
	of its components, and so the average of all the Appearance scores
	is taken.  If component folk of different sexes form the hybrid,
	then it looks androgynous.
	* Most Physical Powers carry through into the hybrid- especially such
	Powers as Extra Body Parts or Body Weaponry.
	* The hybrid has normal Health Levels plus one for every extra person
	in the gestalt- so a two-person gestalt would typically have eight
	Health Levels.  The extra Health Levels for Body Armour, etc., are
	added after this.  These hybrid Health Levels do not count towards
	to normal limit for Extra Health Levels.
	* If two characters in the gestalt have the same Power and it carries
	over into the hybrid, the hybrid has the Power at the higher Rank.
	* Typically, Social and Mental Powers are lost, but if all the
	characters in the gestalt have the same Power, it carries over at
	the highest Rank.
	
	Note that separation (if the hybrid has all of its component minds)
	requires a contested Willpower roll if not all of the components want
	to separate.
	
	Variation: Social Hybrid: If this Power is the only Physical Power
	that the characters in the hybrid possess (the balance being Social)
	then the hybrid may inherit Social Powers instead.  This is still a
	Physical Power.
	
	Variation: Merge to form Devastator! (3 points): This variation costs
	three freebie points, but allows the mutant to discard the Powers
	that the components bring into the Gestalt, and generate entirely new
	ones.  These are randomly generated or chosen by the ST, but always
	have the same number of Ranks (considering each Rank in a double-cost
	Power to be two Ranks) as the mutant with the highest number of Ranks.
	This Gestalt will form the same hybrid every time the characters merge,
	and the hybrid may earn its own experience points and advance its own
	Powers.
	
	¥¥ Two characters can merge into a hybrid.
	¥¥¥ Three characters can merge into a hybrid.
	¥¥¥¥ Four characters can merge into a hybrid.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five characters can merge into a hybrid.

Physical Imitation (Physical) [AL]
	This limited, though highly functional, variation of Shapeshifting
	allows a mutant to touch and thus 'assimilate' a target for future
	imitation.  Mystique has this power.  Usually, the possessors of this
	Power do not truly have most of the abilities of the people that they
	assimilate, even if it appears that they do (for instance, Mystique
	cannot truly duplicate the Strength of the Thing), but some powers
	would copy exactly (like Wolverine's bone claws, or Angel's wings).
	Only living humanoids can be assimilated.  This is an Appearance +
	Disguise roll (diff of the effective Rank of the effect + 4). The only
	limitation on who you can assimilate is amount by which you can change
	your own size.
	
	Variation: Animal Mimicry- instead of assimilating humans, the mutant
	can take the form of animals.  Only living animals can be assimilated
	(though they can then be imitated long after the original creature's
	death). This is a Stamina + Animal Ken roll (diff of the effective Rank
	of the effect + 4).
	
	Variation: Item Imitation- instead of assimilating humans, the mutant
	can take the form of items that he has previously touched.  This is a
	Stamina + Repair roll (diff of the effective Rank of the effect + 2).
	
	¥ Mass changes of +/- 20 pounds are possible; height changes of up
	to 3 inches can be done.
	¥¥ Mass changes of +/- 50 pounds are possible; height can change by
	as much as 6 inches.
	¥¥¥ Up to 100 pounds either way; height changes up to a foot.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to 200 pounds either way; height changes up to two feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to 400 pounds either way; height changes up to three feet.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Up to 600 pounds and four feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Up to 800 pounds and five feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Up to 1000 pounds and six feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Up to 1500 pounds and seven feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Up to a ton and eight feet.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Give Voice- the imitation is close enough that the mutant's voice
	exactly resembles the voice of the assimilated.  Perception +
	Mimicry (Talent), diff 4 (one-time roll).
	¥¥ Scent State- requires Heightened Senses (Smell).  The mutant can
	copy the smell of the target, making her scent indistinguishable
	from it.  Perception + Mimicry, diff 7 (one-time roll).
	¥¥ Mannerisms- if the mutant has studied the person that she is
	going to assimilate for a few days, she will be able to duplicate
	the physical mannerisms of that person.  Perception + Mimicry,
	diff 8.
	¥¥¥ Animal Speech (Animal Mimicry only)- if the animal in question is
	capable of communication, the mutant may learn the language using a
	special variation of Linguistics (Animal Linguistics).
	¥¥¥ Minor Alterations- the mutant has the ability to merge the
	characteristics of the forms she has emulated to create new hybrids.
	Stamina + Physical Imitation, difficulty varies with the changes
	made.
	¥¥¥ Facelift- requires the Stunt: Minor Alterations.  The mutant can
	avoid growing old through the simple expedient of using this power
	to keep rebuilding the damage.  No roll required.
	¥¥¥¥ Flawless- The mutant can become a physically flawless Imitation of
	a person complete with fingerprints, retina and all.
	¥¥¥¥ Healing- requires the Stunt: Minor Alterations.  The mutant can
	heal by making alterations to the form that she is currently in,
	healing up to one Health Level of damage per round with concentration
	if non-aggravated, or one Level per hour if aggravated.  Stamina +
	Physical Imitation (diff 5 + current dice penalties).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Dead Flesh- the mutant does not need to touch a person to assume
	his physical appearance; a piece of that person, such as bone, hair,
	cuticle, is all that is required.  A smaller the portion, the higher 
	the difficulty (which is at +2, base).

Physical Law Control* (Social) [AH]
	This Power allows its user to take control of small packets of space,
	and in so doing, take command of their grosser physical laws.  That
	is, the mutant will, as she progresses in Rank, take command of the
	speed of the flow of time, the strength of gravity and magnetism, and
	even the tendency of certain substances to react chemically with each
	other.  Her control will only extend into the packet of space upon
	which she focuses her concentration, so it will be almost impossible
	to cause someone to spin off into space using this Power.  The typical
	roll to make any change is Manipulation + Physical Law Control.  Note
	that the mutant cannot directly affect living creatures with this
	Power, nor can he cause existing matter to ionize or disintegrate, nor
	can he reverse the flow of time.  To change any law requires heavy
	concentration and takes an action; to maintain any number of changes
	requires light concentration.
	
	Variation: Micro-Environment* [AN]- as per the regular Power, except
	the parameters (changes in time-flow, gravity, or other such details)
	are fixed at character creation, and this Power is active all the time.
	No roll is required.
	
	¥ The mutant can change the working of any of nature's grosser physical
	laws within a five foot radius.
	¥¥ The range is ten feet.
	¥¥¥ Fifteen foot radius.
	¥¥¥¥ Twenty-five foot radius.
	¥¥¥¥¥ One hundred foot radius.

Physical Possession (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	Like Mountjoy, Sebastian Shaw's mutant toady from the Hellfire Club, a
	character with this power can 'climb into' another person and just plain
	take over.  A sort of tactile density control (activated upon touching
	another living being) allows the mutant to phase out and take up the
	same space as another person, essentially setting up shop there and
	making his will known.  If any roll other than a Willpower check is
	required to be made, it will typically be a Stamina check.
	
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can attempt to 'climb into' another person, subjecting
	them to a one-time Willpower check (difficulty 7) as a sort of 'test
	of wills'.  This is a resisted roll.  If the target succeeds, the mutant 
	is forced out.  On the other hand, if the mutant succeeds, he can control 
	the target in all things until he loses his concentration, whereupon the 
	victim gets a second chance to push him out.  If the target has a higher 
	Permanent Willpower score than the mutant, he gets one additional check 
	per point in excess of the mutant's score each time they struggle for
	control.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Blend Over- the possessed body must make a Stamina check.  For
	every success, one Rank of the possessor's Passive Powers is
	transferred for the duration of the possession.

Physical Transformation (Physical) [AL]
	Any mutant who undergoes a set change of shape without suffering a
	change in personality or a radical change of chemical composition has
	this power.  Wolfsbane of Excalibur has it, and so did the Thing when
	he had the ability to shift forms at will.  This transformation need
	not be into a monstrous shape, or even an especially formidable one,
	but it often does take this form.  No Attribute may be increased by
	more points than the mutant's Actual Power Level.  Wolfsbane took this
	power twice to give her a wolf-woman form and a full wolf form. 
	Transformation takes an action.  Only one form is chosen when this
	Power is selected (so the Attribute bonuses are fixed). This is a
	Stamina + Transformation roll (diff 6).

	Special Flaw: Forced Transformation (1-3 point Flaw)- the mutant must
	make a Willpower check, diff 6, and garner as many successes as she
	has ranks in this Power, to avoid shifting involuntarily under certain
	situations:
		* When you take damage (1)
		* When you perceive a physical threat (1)
		* When you come into contact with a certain substance (1-3 points
		based on the substance's rarity)
		* Under the influence of alcohol (2)
		* Under the full moon (2)
		* When sexually aroused (2)
		* When you get angry (3)
		* When you sleep (3)
	Other situations are possible, of course.

	Special Flaw: Dim Veil (2 or 5 point Flaw)- the mutant has only hazy
	memories of what she does when in transformed form, if any at all.  This
	may land her in trouble as a result.  For 5 points, the transformed form
	has its own agenda and slightly different personality, that may clash
	with that of the mutant's normal form.  Note that this is not a fully
	realized separate personality; not invokable by Telepathy, etc.

	Special Flaw: Dependent Power (1-7 point Flaw)- one of the mutant's
	Powers only comes into play when she undergoes her transformation.  This
	is typically a Physical Power such as Body Weaponry or Altered Perceptions
	(Heightened Senses).  The value of the Flaw is equal to the Rank of the
	Power (to a maximum of seven points).

	¥ Three points to distribute among Strength, Dexterity, Stamina,
	Appearance, and Perception.  Any subtraction from these attributes
	that comes with the change adds a die to the pool.  Alternately,
	a Health Level costs two points.  Points can not be allocated to
	attributes that are already boosted by the Power: Mega-Attribute.
	¥¥ Five points to distribute.
	¥¥¥ Seven points to distribute.
	¥¥¥¥ Nine points to distribute.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Eleven points to distribute.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Fourteen points to distribute.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seventeen points, and Wits is also a candidate.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Twenty points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Twenty-three points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty-seven points

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Distribution- if the mutant's new Form has a Flaw (One Arm,
	Monstrous Appearance, etc.), she gets the Freebie points from it
	to apply to Talents, Skills, or Knowledges while in form.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Brain Drain- the mutant can reduce Charisma, Manipulation,
	Intelligence, and Wits for extra points.

Plant Control (Social) [AL]
	This Power, possessed by Black Tom Cassidy and Poison Ivy (sure,
	she's DC, but she's a little less obscure than Black Tom), allows
	a mutant to control the growth and movements of plants, and in
	the process accelerate these processes to an unholy degree, even
	making them grow far beyond their natural size.  The mutant can
	also damage plants.  Eight-foot tall Venus Flytrap bodyguards,
	anyone?  Manipulation + Plant Control, diff 6.  Plants are also
	fully capable of movement with this Power, though they will
	eventually die if they are not allowed to take nourishment.
	If a plant is grown beyond a certain size, it becomes brittle and/or
	difficult to Control.
	
	¥ Any plant of up to 1 cubic foot in volume can be controlled,
	growing at a rate of 20% of the plant's current volume per round.
	Two Health Levels of damage can be inflicted or healed on any plant.
	The mutant does not lose control of the plant just because it
	grows too large UNLESS she loses her concentration.
	¥¥ Any plant of up to 5 cubic feet in volume can be controlled,
	growing at a rate of 50% per round.  Four Health Levels of damage
	can be inflicted or healed on any plant.
	¥¥¥ Any plant of up to 20 cubic feet in volume can be controlled,
	growing at a rate of 100% per round.  Six Health Levels of damage
	can be inflicted or healed on any plant.
	¥¥¥¥ Any plant of up to 100 cubic feet in volume can be controlled,

	¥¥¥¥¥ Any plant can be controlled, growing at a rate of 500% per

	on any plant.
	
	Additional Info:
	* Assume that a tough vine has three Health Levels until it is cut,
	two Stamina to soak with, and a Strength of 4 for grappling/strangling
	purposes.  A redwood, by contrast, would have 5 Stamina and a Strength
	of 10 for grappling, strangling, or pummeling, with 25 Health Levels.
	Go nuts.
	* The aforementioned eight-foot tall Venus Fly Trap, in case you're
	interested, would have five Health Levels, a Strength of 4, and a
	Strength + 1 Bite.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Infest- making seeds start to grow on any surface and spreading roots
	in through the surface (this inflicts one Health Level of damage/Rank).
	¥¥¥ Sprout- make chairs (or other wooden object) grow, into whatever it
	was before or form it into something else.

Plant Physiology (Physical) [PN]
	Once your mutant reached puberty, a radical transformation took place,
	and her body chemistry and physiology changed to resemble that of a
	mobile plant(!)  A very strange Power, to be sure, but one with  number
	of interesting uses and implications.  Black Tom Cassidy has somehow
	managed to get this Power.  No roll is required under most
	circumstances.
	
	* Telepathy, Psychic Blasts, and other related Powers and abilities are
	all at +2 difficulty to detect or affect you.
	* Most poisons and diseases will not affect you.
	* You are completely immune to Biomanipulation.
	* Your requirements for food are usually changed.  This can allow you
	to take energy from sunlight, if you so desire.
	* You usually end up with the Flaw: Monstrous Appearance (2).
	* You can be affected by the Power: Plant Control.
	* The Power: Healing (Others) is at +2 difficulty to affect you.
	
	¥¥¥ You have the physiology of a plant form.  Very weird.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Healing Earth- when the mutant sets down roots in fertile soil, she
	heals one Health Level of aggravated damage or three Health levels of
	normal damage per 8-hour period of rest.
	¥¥¥ Plant Control- the mutant may purchase the Power: Plant Control
	with Experience points.
	¥¥¥ Natural Camouflage- the mutant gets three extra dice for all
	Stealth dice pools when in a jungle or forest setting.
	¥¥¥ Healing Light- the mutant may purchase the Power: Energy Absorption
	and Conversion (Light) in the Health variation with Experience points
	if she feeds with photosynthesis.

Possession (Mental) [AH]
	Like Karma of the New Mutants, a mutant with this power is able to
	'reach out' with her mind to dominate others.  Unlike Mountjoy's
	Physical Possession, the mutant maintains a distinct (though a bit
	distracted) presence in her own body, which can also perform some
	actions.  A possessed body can be used in any number of ways, but
	it's great for combat.
	
	When the mutant is possessing someone, she can do anything that the
	normal controller of the body can do, but at +1 difficulty.  If the
	mutant wants to perform an action that round with her own body, both
	of them perform actions at an additional +2 difficulty.  If she fails
	in her own body's action, that is sufficient distraction for the 
	victim to make another Willpower check.
	
	¥ The mutant makes a contested Willpower check, difficulty of 6 + the
	victim's Rank in Telepathy or Psychic Defense.  The opponent's diff to
	resist is 6.  If the mutant wins, he has control over the affected
	person for one round.  At the end of that time, or if the mutant
	becomes distracted, the victim can attempt to make another Willpower
	check to oust her.
	¥¥ Difficulty 7 to resist.  The control lasts one round.
	¥¥¥ Difficulty 8 to resist.  The control lasts one scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulty 9 to resist.  The control lasts one scene.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulty 9 to resist.  The control lasts one day.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Difficulty 9 to resist.  The control lasts one day per Willpower
	point that the mutant has in excess of the victim's score.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Difficulty 9 to resist.  Control is perpetual unless a
	distraction occurs.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Difficulty 10 to resist.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Skinride- the mutant can possess someone without the victim being
	aware of her presence.  This is a Manipulation + Possession roll
	(does not require the contested Willpower roll, above), though the
	mutant is not capable of coercion unless that struggle for dominance
	is made.  The difficulty is the opponent's Perception + Intuition.
	¥¥¥¥ Avatar- by spending a point of Power Charge while possessing a
	victim, the mutant's difficulty to possess him in the future is
	reduced by one.

Possibility Forging* (Social) [AL]
	This ability is an especially valuable specialization of precognition.
	Maverick, as he was originally conceived, had this Power.  So does
	Freestyle of the Deviants (that's from Wildstorm, not Marvel).  It is
	the ability to see all of the possible futures, and the actions that
	would lead to them.  The mutant simply picks the most advantageous one
	by behaving in a given way.  The more powerful the mutant is in this
	Power, the farther she can penetrate into the future.  The normal roll
	for this is Perception + Possibility Forging, but at high Ranks there
	are so many possible futures that a Wits + Possibility Forging roll
	may be required for the mutant's mind to process all the data.  The
	normal effects of this Power are left up to the storyteller, but the
	game mechanics and combat effects are as follows:
	
	¥ The mutant can see into the next round (about ten seconds).  The
	mutant can make a Perception + Possibility Forging roll.  If she
	succeeds, all ones are ignored for the next round (and treated as 
	failures rather than botches)
	¥¥ The mutant can see into the next minute (about six rounds).  All
	ones are ignored for that period on a successful roll, and all twos
	are rerolled once.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can see to the end of the scene.  All ones are ignored
	for that period on a successful roll, and all twos and threes are
	rerolled once.
	¥¥¥¥ It is possible to see to the end of the day.  All ones are
	rerolled for that period, and all twos, threes, and fours are 
	rerolled once.
	¥¥¥¥¥ It is possible to see to the end of the week.  All ones are
	rerolled for that period, and all twos, threes, fours, and fives
	are rerolled once.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Time Sense- the mutant can detect temporal anomalies in the
	immediate area on a successful Perception + Possibility Forging (diff
	6) and can recognize a time-displaced (or dimension-displaced) person
	as well (diff 8).
	¥¥¥ Destiny Sense - the mutant will occasionally get little
	precognitive 'flashes' outside of his normal time range.  This cannot
	be controlled, but is most likely to relate to a specific person, and
	most often it is related to a person with destiny.

Postcognition (Mental) [AH]
	A power that is shared by folks such as Hindsight Lad and 'Know-What-
	The-Hell-Just-Happened Man' (OK, so it's unglamorous.  That doesn't
	mean it ain't useful), Postcognition is the ability to replay the
	recent past in your head and 'see' what happened.  This can come in
	handy when you've just had the wool pulled over your eyes, and can be
	downright indispensable if you also have Clairvoyance, Clairaudience,
	or some other, related, power.  Basically, your sensible past is your
	oyster.  All the senses are employed and engaged by this Power unless
	you are using it in combination with Clairvoyance (in which case only
	sight is engaged) or Clairaudience.  Perception + Postcognition
	(diff 6).
	
	¥ See what happened in your character's immediate area in the last
	scene.
	¥¥ See what happened yesterday.
	¥¥¥ See what happened last week.
	¥¥¥¥ See what happened last year.
	¥¥¥¥¥ See what's happened since your birth.
	
	Postcognition/Ancestral Memory Power Stunts:
	¥/¥¥ You can see what happened to your ancestors as well, through their
	eyes, dated backward by Rank from their deaths. 

	Postcognition/Past Lives Power Stunts:
	¥/¥ See what happened in your past lives, dated backward from death by
	Rank.

Power Absorption (Social) [AL]
	This is the ability to "steal" powers for yourself.  Unlike Power
	Mimicry, Power Absorption usually gives the thief the built-in
	defenses that the stolen powers come with.  The range for this power
	is nearly always touch.  The newly-stolen power may be used for one
	scene, in most cases.  The Rank of this temporary power is equal to
	the Rank of the original Power, or this Power, whichever is the lower.
	A Power of a rank that exceeds this Power's rank is only partially
	stolen- the target mutant "keeps" any Power Ranks that the mutant was
	not able to steal.  Extremely high Ranking powers may be painful to
	attempt to steal and this Power may fail outright in such cases. The
	new Power will not have any Power Stunts.  When the maximum number of
	Powers that the mutant can Absorb has been reached, this power shuts
	off.  Rogue is the most famous holder of this Power, though she also
	steals the memories of the target (which allows her to steal Power
	Stunts as well, but it can have some nasty side effects).  No roll is
	required beyond the initial Dex + Brawl roll to touch the victim for
	Active Powers; to absorb a Passive Power requires that the mutant
	spend a point of Power Charge.  Continuous (one round) contact is
	required to absorb a Power, so a normal Brawling attack will not
	activate this Power.
	
	¥ One power can be copied at a time, at rank 1.
	¥¥ Two powers can be copied, at rank 2.
	¥¥¥ Three powers can be copied, at rank 3.
	¥¥¥¥ Four powers can be copied, at rank 4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five powers can be copied, at rank 5.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six powers at Rank five or less, or three rank 6.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Six at Rank five or less, three at rank 7 or less.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Six at Rank five or less, three at rank 8 or less.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Six at Rank five or less, three at rank 6, 7 or 8, or two
	at rank 9.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Six at Rank five or less, three at rank 6, 7, or 8, two
	at rank 9, or one at rank 10.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Memory Theft- Beware!  This Power Stunt allows the mutant to steal
	the memories of the target as well, usually (unless the target gets
	more successes than the mutant's Rank in this Power on a diff 7 
	Willpower check) rendering the target unconscious, but a variety of
	unpleasant side effects are possible.  This Stunt, when used, is
	fully subject to the Psychic Backlash and Psychic Defense powers.
	The target's memories will return within a few minutes.

Power Amplification (Social) [AL]
	This power will make your mutant very popular as a potential group
	player.  You cannot amplify your OWN powers, but you can boost the
	power levels of the mutants around you.  Fabian Cortez has this
	ability, and he is much feared for it.  Apocalypse also has this
	power.  Although a mutant's power cannot be boosted beyond the
	level of his Power Potential, the increase that IS possible is
	often too much for your opponents to handle.  Requires concentration.
	Charisma + Power Amplification (diff of the mutant's Power
	Potential for Active Powers; double the difficulty for Passive ones.
	If the difficulty becomes more than ten, the Power will not
	function).
	
	¥ Boost the Power Rank of one power of one mutant by one, to the
	maximum of his Power Potential.
	¥¥ Boost the Rank by two.
	¥¥¥ Boost the Rank by three.
	¥¥¥¥ Boost the Rank by four.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Boost the Rank by five.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Boost the Rank of two powers by up to five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Boost the Rank of three powers by up to five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Boost the Rank of four powers by up to five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Boost the Rank of five powers by up to five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Boost the Rank of six powers by up to five.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Power Overload- the mutant can purposefully increase a target's
	Power Rank faster than the victim's body can handle.  If the Rank
	of the Power increases to a level beyond the victim's Stamina, he
	will be forced to soak one Health Level of damage per Rank of the
	Power (the new Rank, that is).

Power Dampening (Social) [AL]
	A weaker (or perhaps, more versatile) version of the Power Negation
	ability, save that it works no matter how powerful the target is. You
	cannot dampen your OWN powers, but you can dampen the power levels of
	the mutants around you.  The Morlock Leech has this ability.  Power
	Ranks can be reduced to zero (inoperative) through this Power.  This is
	a more gentle drain than Power Negation, and will not cause the target
	to go into shock.  Note that this power does not dampen the effects of
	powers already used- once the ace of spades from Gambit's deck is in
	the air, using this power will not drain the charge from the card.  It
	would not revert Colossus to his flesh form either, though it might
	prevent him from assuming it.  A Manipulation + Power Dampening (diff
	5) is required to dampen Active Powers; it will not work at all on
	Passive ones.

	¥ Decrease the Power Ranks of one mutant's powers by one
	¥¥ Decrease the Ranks by two.
	¥¥¥ Decrease the Ranks by three.
	¥¥¥¥ Decrease the Ranks by four.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Decrease the Ranks by five.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Decrease the Ranks of two mutants' powers by up to five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Four mutants.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Six mutants.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Eight mutants.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten mutants.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Multi-tasking- the mutant may split the Ranks that he drains
	among several mutants- so at Rank two, he may dampen the Powers
	of two mutants by one Rank each.

Power Duplication** (Social) [AL]
	Taboo of the Archons and the Super-Adaptoid have this Power, which
	precludes all other Powers- at least in the beginning.  In essence,
	this Power allows the mutant to collect more Powers- cool, eh?  Of
	course, there is an absolute limit to the number of Powers that the
	mutant can absorb, but if she has hit the limit and takes in a new one,
	then an old one is 'bumped out'.  This Power requires continuous
	contact for at least a round (a punch to the jaw won't do it) and the
	expenditure of at least one point of Willpower. If the Power is
	Passive, it also requires a point of Power Charge. The new Power is
	either duplicated at Rank one (if possible) or at the lowest Rank in
	which it appears- so duplicating Physical Gestalt would create the
	Power at Rank two.  No Power that has a minimum Rank higher than the
	mutant's Actual Power Level can be duplicated.  In any case, each Rank
	that is duplicated requires a point of Willpower.  The only Power that
	cannot be 'bumped out' is this one.  Unless the mutant has the Flaw:
	Involuntary Power attached to this Power, she can choose which Power
	gets bumped. Note also that whenever the mutant duplicates a Power that
	has a specific Flaw attached to it (or a variation), she also
	duplicates the Flaw or variation.
	
	All Powers duplicated by this Power can be improved normally with
	Experience, including Tertiary Powers (though these are at 10x
	current).  If the mutant improves a Power, bumps it, and later
	duplicates it again, it returns at its former Rank (rather than at its
	minimum Rank). 

	Note also that if the mutant ever suffers from amnesia or Power
	Negation for any period, she will lose all her absorbed Powers.  Power
	Negation, Autumn Force, Conferral, and Nemesis Power cannot (for
	obvious reasons) be duplicated by this Power.
	
	¥ The mutant can have a total of three Powers- this one and two
	others.
	¥¥ Four Powers.
	¥¥¥ Five Powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Six Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Seven Powers.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Perma-burn: The mutant may choose to sacrifice one of the slots
	that hold Powers by spending a point of Permanent Willpower.  One
	Power is then kept permanently, and will not (in fact, cannot) be
	'bumped'.

Power Feedback* (Social) [AL]
	An especially nasty Power that is possessed by Fabian Cortez of the
	Acolytes, Power Feedback allows a target mutant to build up and
	release the mitochondrial energy that fuels Powers, but not in the
	form of the Power in question.  In other words, the energy that was
	to make the Power 'go' is instead allowed to run free in the target
	mutant's body.  Naturally, this only applies to active Powers; any
	Power that is passive is not subject to the effects of Power Feedback.
	Normally, Power Feedback requires concentration on the target mutant;
	essentially 'waiting' for the mutant to use his or her Powers.  There
	is, however, a more passive version.

	Variation: Receptive Power Feedback* [AN]- this Power does not work
	at the behest of the mutant, but instead works whenever any active
	Power is used to directly affect him.  Thus, Telepathy or Voice of
	Command will feed back on the sender because they are direct effects;
	on the other hand, Earth Control will not, even if it is used to
	cause an earthquake that damages the mutant.  Area effect Powers are
	not immune to nullification, nor are Powers that affect many targets
	at once.

	Variation: Mord-Sith* [AL]- named for characters from Terry Goodkind's
	Sword of Truth novels, this variation does not target Powers, but
	magic (particularly, Hedge Magic, True Magick, Thaumaturgy, and
	Necromancy).

	This Power affects any mutant, regardless of ability or Rank in her
	Powers- the one exception is Autumn Force.  The Receptive Power
	Feedback variation will defeat it, but the regular version cannot
	target it, and will be lost as normal.  The normal system for this
	Power is Manipulation + Power Feedback (difficulty of 3 + the target
	mutant's Actual Power Level.  Treat difficulties higher than ten
	as difficulty 10, with an increase in the number of successes required)

	¥ The Power fails and the offending mutant receives a nasty headache
	that lasts an hour or so.  This is distracting enough to warrant a
	-1 die penalty on actions requiring delicate concentration.
	¥¥ The Power fails and the offending mutant is blasted by biofeedback;
	he loses a point of Power Charge and receives a nasty headache as per
	Rank one.
	¥¥¥ The Power fails and the offending mutant is blasted by biofeedback;
	he loses a point of Power Charge and takes three Health Levels of
	aggravated damage (soakable).  He also receives a blinding headache-
	a minimum -1 die penalty.  This penalty is not cumulative with penalties
	for Health loss.
	¥¥¥¥ The Power fails and the offending mutant is blasted by feedback;
	he loses a point of Power Charge and takes one Health Level of damage
	(aggravated) per Rank in the Power that he was going to use- or three
	Health Levels, whichever is greater.  He must succeed in a Stamina check
	(diff 6) to avoid losing consciousness.  If he remains conscious, he
	suffers from a blinding headache, as per Rank three.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The Power fails and the offending mutant is blasted by feedback;
	he loses one point of Power Charge per Rank in the Power that he was
	going to use, and takes one Health Level of aggravated damage per Rank
	in that Power- or three Health Levels, whichever is greater.  He must
	check for consciousness as per Rank four, and will suffer the same
	headache.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Taken Control- with a Charisma + PMF roll and a point of Power
	Charge or Gnosis, the mutant can continue to punish a victim with the
	energy from his own Power, once it has been used.  That is to say,
	the mutant may elect to inflict the damage whether or not the Power
	is used, for the rest of the scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Distracting Pain- victims of the Feedback suffer an increase in
	concentration level for many Powers for the rest of the scene.  Low-
	concentration Powers become high-concentration, and high-concentration
	Powers become impossible to use.  Passive Powers and Powers requiring
	no concentration are unaffected.

Power Gestalt (Social) [AL]
	Aurora and Northstar of Alpha Flight have this Power, which allows
	them to trigger a blast of light when they touch.  In the same
	way, the mutant will combine with another mutant, which normally
	requires physical contact, to use a Power which only exists when
	they are in contact with each other.  No roll apart from any
	roll necessary to establish physical contact is needed. While this 
	might seem more like a handicap than a Power, consider the following:
	
	* Both mutants must purchase this Power.
	* Another Power is selected for free (at Rank One, though this may
	be improved with Freebie points or remaining Ranks).
	* This other Power can be in a mutant's Tertiary category.
	* Either mutant may improve the Power with Experience, and either
	may purchase Power Stunts for it.
	* This Power cannot be negated, mimicked, or stolen if the mutants
	are not touching.
	* The potential Rank of this other Power is at the Power Potential
	of the mutant with the higher score in that trait.
	
	¥ One Power can be held in Gestalt.
	¥¥ Two Powers can be held in Gestalt.  If this Power was increased
	to this Rank by Experience (and it must be done by both mutants to
	be effective), then another Power can be purchased with Experience
	by either mutant and put into Gestalt.  The normal guidelines for
	purchasing a new Power must be followed.
	¥¥¥ Three Powers can be held in Gestalt.
	¥¥¥¥ Four Powers can be held in Gestalt.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Powers can be held in Gestalt.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Psychic Link- the mutants may purchase the Power: Psychic Link
	with Experience.
	¥¥ Open Slot- requires the Powers: Power Absorption or Power Mimicry
	to be held by one of the mutants.  If the mutants have not purchased
	a second Gestalt Power, a stolen Power may be put into that slot
	and later purchased with Experience as a Gestalt Power.

Power Manipulation Backlash (Social) [PN]
	Some mutants have Powers which strongly resist being stolen, changed,
	copied, dampened, or augmented.  A mutant with this Power is just such
	a one.  Any mutant who attempts to affect his Powers with such Powers
	as Power Absorption, Power Amplification, Power Dampening, Power
	Mimicry, Power Negation, or Power Puppetry will suffer from some nasty 
	psychic feedback as a result of his tampering.  The attacker suffers from 
	a painful blast (soak three Health levels of damage, lose a point of 
	Power Charge) and the attempt fails.  No roll is required.
	
	¥¥ No-one will be messing with this mutant's Powers.

Power Mimicry (Social) [AL]
	This much sought-after power allows a mutant to "copy" another mutant's
	power and use it herself.  The Mimic is the most notable example of
	this power, though Gideon the External and the Super Adaptoid also
	possess it.  The newly-copied power can be used for one scene, in
	most cases.  The mutant may not be able to copy passive powers (that
	do not rely on concentration- many physical powers), and may not
	get the built-in defenses of powers that need them (like Hyper-Speed).
	The Rank of this temporary power is equal to the Rank of the original
	Power, or this Power, whichever is the lower.  Note that if the Rank
	of a Power exceeds this one, it can still be Mimicked.  It will just
	appear with a lower power level.  The new Power will not have any
	Power Stunts.  When the maximum number of Powers that the mutant can
	Mimic has been reached, this power shuts off.  The mutant must observe
	(and will often suffer the results of) a power in order to copy it.
	A Perception + Power Mimicry (diff of the Rank + 4) is required for
	active Powers; the difficulty to Mimic a passive Power is Rank + 6.
	
	¥ One power can be copied at a time, at rank 1.
	¥¥ Two powers can be copied, at rank 2.
	¥¥¥ Three powers can be copied, at rank 3.
	¥¥¥¥ Four powers can be copied, at rank 4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five powers can be copied, at rank 5.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Physical Safeguards- built in defenses for Physical Powers (such
	as bones strong enough to handle Mega-Strength, or lungs capable of
	breathing during high-speed Flight) come along with mimicked Powers.
	¥¥¥ Physical Transformation- any passive Physical Power may be
	copied, such as Body Weaponry or Altered Perceptions.
	¥¥¥ Social Safeguards- built in defenses for Social Powers (such as
	barriers between 'received' emotion and the mutant's emotions for
	Passive Empathy) come along with mimicked Powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Mental Safeguards- built in defenses for Mental Powers (such as
	the ability to physically survive the rigours of a Psionic Furnace)
	come along with mimicked Powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Social Transformation- any passive Social Power may be copied,
	such as Empathic Resistance or Magic Resistance.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mental Transformation- any passive Mental Power may be copied,
	such as Ancestral Memory or Psychic Defense.

Power Negation (Social) [AL]
	This deadly and widely-feared power allows a mutant to nullify the
	mutant powers of his opponents.  It may also work on Changelings and
	Magick. The mutant can negate any and all active Powers that are of
	the same Rank as this Power or lower, but cannot target passive
	Powers.  It would have no effect on Archangel's wings, but it would
	nullify Wolverine's Healing Factor if it was powerful enough.  It
	would not affect Wolvie's claws, though.  Scrambler of the Marauders
	has this Power.  The target, if he loses more total Power Ranks than
	he has Stamina, will go into shock for a number of rounds equal to the
	Rank of the most potent Power he lost. A roll to hit (Dex + Brawl) is
	required.  This nullification lasts a scene unless reversed.

	¥ Negates all Powers of Rank one status.
	¥¥ Negates all Powers that are Rank two or less.
	¥¥¥ Negates Rank three Powers.
	¥¥¥¥ Negates Rank four Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Negates Rank five Powers.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Negates Rank six Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Negates Rank seven Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Negates Rank eight Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Negates Rank nine Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Negates Rank ten Powers.

Power Puppetry (Social) [AH]
	A mutant with this Power can take control of another's Powers and
	use them as he wills.  He can activate them, prevent them from
	being used, or even control the amount of output (raising 
	difficulties or lowering damage pools, perhaps).  This rarely
	applies to Physical Powers, and cannot affect Powers that are
	passive or involuntary (including Powers that are normally easy
	to control, if the victim happens to have the Flaw: Involuntary
	Power).  The victim gets a resistance roll only if she is aware
	of the manipulation- of course, it will probably become obvious
	in short order!  The system is either Manipulation + Power Puppetry
	(if the victim is unaware of the interference) or a contested
	Willpower roll.  A separate roll is required for each act of
	Puppetry.
	
	Note that more than one Power can be affected at once by Power
	Puppetry, but through maintenance effects only-- i.e., the mutant
	shuts off one of her victim's Powers in the first round, and in
	the second round (losing one die from all pools to maintain the
	effect) she causes another one to activate.  The mutant can
	affect a number of Powers equal to his Rank in Power Puppetry.
	
	If the mutant affects more than one person (each losing the 
	control of one Power, for example), the difficulty to resist
	is reduced by one point for each extra person.  For example,
	if two persons each had Powers blocked by someone with Rank 3
	Puppetry (say, one person has two Powers blocked, and the other
	loses one) each individual has to resist at difficulty 6, not
	diff 7.  That mutant, having affected her Rank's worth of Powers
	between the two persons, can not then control another, or even
	spread control to another person (unless she relinquishes 
	control of one of the Powers she currently controls).
	
	¥ The mutant can activate (or deactivate) another's Powers.
	Psychic Defenses (if possessed by the victim) add one point
	of difficulty to the Puppeteer's roll per Rank.  The range is
	line-of-sight.  The difficulty to resist is 5.  In the rare case
	that the mutant is attempting to affect a Physical Power, any
	special resistance to Biomanipulation may also apply against
	this Power.
	¥¥ Difficulty 6 to resist.
	¥¥¥ Difficulty 7 to resist.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulty 8 to resist.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulty 9 to resist.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Flare- the mutant can spend a point of Power Charge to 'max
	out' the effects of a victim's Power as she would with her own
	Powers.  The victim does not himself lose Power Charge.
	¥¥¥¥ Fine Manipulation- rather than the typical gross effects,
	the mutant can attempt to use a victim's Power with more subtlety
	and efficiency.  For example, she could attempt to mind-control
	someone using a victim's Telepathy, as opposed to merely inducing
	emotional states, etc.  The difficulty for this is the victim's
	typical difficulty + 3.

Power Resistance (Social) [AN]
	Your mutant is highly resistant to a particular type or category of
	Powers.  When faced with a Power of that particular type, your mutant
	may always make a resistance roll (even when one is normally
	disallowed), adding his Rank in this Power to the dice pool.  If no
	dice pool is suggested, then the mutant will use either Stamina (to
	resist physical attacks), Wits (to resist mental attacks), or Charisma
	(to resist Powers that significantly alter the world, such as some
	Social Powers).  The player must choose a variation when this Power is
	selected.  Note that some Powers in this vein already exist-- see
	Energy Resistance, Resistance to Fate, Power Manipulation Backlash,
	Singularity, Vampiric Feedback, Telekinetic Shadow, Immutable Pattern,
	Empathic Resistance, and Psychic Invulnerability.
	
	Variations:
	* Body Manipulation Resistance-- resist Biomanipulation, Physical
		Possession, the Aggressive Mass-Shifting stunt, etc.
	* Spatial Manipulation Resistance-- resist Teleportation, Time
		Travel, Nexus energy, etc.
	* Manipulation Resistance-- resist Hypnosis, Persuasion, and some
		applications of Mega-Manipulation and Mega-Charisma.
	* Domination Resistance-- resist Puppetry, Possession, Voice of
		Command, and certain applications of Telepathy
	* Energy Manipulation Resistance-- resist Energy Control and like
		Powers that atttempt to affect the mutant directly
	* Perceptual Manipulation Resistance-- resist Alter Senses and
		certain applications of Telepathy.
	
	¥ Add one die to the mutant's pool to resist a certain type of
	Power.
	¥¥ Add two dice.
	¥¥¥ Three dice.  The difficulty to resist the effect can be reduced by
	one.
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice.  The difficulty to resist the effect can be reduced by
	two (or to six, whichever is higher).
	
Power Reversal (Social) [AN]
	Like the deadly Weapon Zero, you have some energy or substace built
	into you that can reverse the intended outcome of a particular power.
	Any time that you are subject to this power, or come into contact with
	it, it changes in its "polarity".  To reverse a power that you are not
	the target of, you must be touching its target or its creator.  No roll
	is required, as the reversal happens automatically on touch.  Note that
	you must be in contact with the power itself, not something that is
	affected by it (so, a mutant shooting you with the Enhanced Accuracy
	power only suffers reversal if you touch the mutant, not if you touch
	the gun, or the bullet, or are the target of the bullet).  A mutant
	that attempts to cure someone with the Healing (Others) power will
	instead harm that person if you're touching the mutant, but not his
	target.  However, a mutant with Basilisk Field will have his power
	reversed as soon as you are within the area of effect-- and a mutant
	trying to heal you will be harming you instead, if you have the
	associated variation.
	
	Variations:
	* Boosting Reversal-- any Power that adds dice to a dice pool (such as
	Yin Channeling, Mega-Attributes, or Psychic Defense) instead subtracts
	a like amount from the dice pool.  The minimum size for any such
	affected pool is one.
	* Difficulty Reversal-- any Power that increases the difficulty
	associated with particular actions, such as Basilisk Field, instaed
	decreases the difficulty by a like amount.  The minimum difficulty for
	any such reversal is 3.  Any Power that reduces the difficulty
	associated with particular actions, such as Invulnerability, instead
	increases the difficulty of using the trait by a like amount. The
	maximum difficulty for any such reversal is 9.
	* Drain Reversal-- any power that drains a particular energy or trait
	to fuel another is reversed.  This applies to most Vampirism powers,
	some Absorption/Conversion variations, etc.  For example, a character
	who absorbs an energy attack to convert it to health instead loses a
	like amount of Health Levels and releases a burst of energy.  It does
	not work if the character in question does not have any of the
	converted material or trait (so, one character who absorbs matter and
	converts it into armour will not be affected if he does not currently
	have the armour. One who simply reshapes absorbed matter will not be
	affected at all).
	* Recovery Reversal-- any recovery Power such as Healing Factor,
	Healing (Others), Accelerated Recovery, or Charge Building instead
	inflict a like amount of drain to the affected trait (loss of Health
	Levels, Willpower, Power Charge, etc.)  The minimum rating in any
	given trait reversed in recovery is 1.
	* Success Reversal-- any power that supplies automatic successes for a
	particular dice pool, such as Iron Will or Enhanced Accuracy (not Body
	Armour or other protective Powers), instead supplies automatic 'ones'.
	
	¥ The power is reversed so long as physical contact is maintained.
	¥¥ The power is reversed for up to one round after physical contact 
	takes place, or for as long as it is maintained.
	¥¥¥ The power is reversed for up to the mutant's Charisma in rounds
	after physical contact takes place, or for as long as it is maintained.
	¥¥¥¥ The power is reversed for up to the mutant's Charisma + Power
	Reversal in rounds after physical contact takes place, or for as long
	as it is maintained.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The power is reversed for up to an hour after physical contact
	takes place, or for as long as it is maintained.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Reverse Reversal- the mutant may elect to avoid reversing a Power
	by making a Willpower check (diff of her Rank in this Power + 4).
	¥¥¥ Reverse Stunt- the mutant may reverse the effect of a stunt that
	matches her variation's description, even if the regular use of the
	associated Power does not.
	
Power Vampirism (Social) [AL]
	A mutant with Power Vampirism can actually drain another mutant's
	energy reserves to fuel her own.  This Power operates at a range of
	touch, and will only function if the mutant has a temporary Power
	Charge that is lower than her permanent Power Charge.  In that case,
	the mutant can drain one point of Power Charge from another mutant
	per round, weakening her victim and strengthening herself.  In no
	way can she drain more Power Charge than she needs, or strengthen
	herself beyond her normal limit.  The system, once the mutant touches
	her victim, is a contested Willpower check.  The attacker's
	difficulty on this check is a seven.  The victim's difficulty varies
	with the attacker's Rank in this Power.
	
	¥ The difficulty to resist is five.
	¥¥ Difficulty six.
	¥¥¥ Difficulty seven.
	¥¥¥¥ Difficulty eight.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Difficulty nine.

Precognition (Mental) [AL]
	Nasty, nasty.  Destiny, formerly of Freedom Force, had(?) the Power to
	dimly see the future as it would unfold.  Although her control over
	this Power was small, dreams and visions would tell her in some detail
	what the future held.  Destiny was even able to predict the hour of
	her own death.  Basically, the mutant can see some of the certainties
	and some of the possibilities that the future holds, which may allow
	some action to be taken.  The Storyteller really holds the reins on
	this Power, for the most part.  This Power has great possibilities for
	abuse; definitely for the experienced player (and Storyteller) only. 
	It is recommended that the player and ST exchange notes when
	conferring on the contents of the future, rather than speak it aloud. 
	In any case, the character will receive visions whenever the ST wants
	to feed the players a little info or put a scare into them.  No roll
	is normally required, though a Perception + Precognition roll may be
	demanded in some situations.
	
	Special Flaw: Blind Spot (1-point Flaw)- the mutant cannot read her
	own future, and will only rarely get insights about it.
	
	¥ Ask the ST one question about the immediate future (up to a scene
	ahead) per game session.
	¥¥ Two questions.
	¥¥¥ Three questions.
	¥¥¥¥ Four questions.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five questions.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Last call- the player always declares her action for the
	round last, regardless of her initiative roll.
	¥¥¥ Movement prediction- any time the mutant wins initiative, her
	foreknowledge of her opponent's moves allows a -2 reduction in
	difficulties to Dodge or hit.

Projective Ectomorph (Physical) [AL]
	Projective Ectomorphs are rare; only Skin and Leong Coy Manh are known
	to possess this bizarre Power.  In essence, it allows the mutant to
	stretch and control his skin, which is more elastic and durable than
	normal.  At higher Ranks, the mutant can actually cause his skin to
	detach from his body- and yet remain in control of it!  The typical
	system for this Power is Dexterity + Projective Ectomorph (difficulty
	5) but other rolls are not unheard of.
	
	¥ The mutant has, at maximum, about three feet of extra skin.  It can
	stretch away from his body at any point, though of course it will
	stretch farther if it comes from the hands or feet.  The skin itself
	has a Strength of 1, one Health Level, and one point of Stamina. It is
	perfectly prehensile.
	¥¥ The mutant has about six feet of extra skin.  The skin is more
	durable, having two Health Levels and Stamina.
	¥¥¥ The mutant has about twelve feet of extra skin.  The skin has
	three Health Levels and Stamina.  The skin has a Strength of 2.
	¥¥¥¥ The skin can actually shear away from the body, rather than
	stretching away from it.  A new, pink skin will lie underneath that
	will not stretch for a few days.  Of course, the 'top' skin can still
	resume its traditional relationship with the body.  The skin is much
	stronger, having a Strength of 3.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The skin can separate from the body entirely and reconfigure
	itself into new shapes.  The mutant can control it by splitting his
	dice pool (or concentrating on it entirely).  The skin has four Health
	Levels and Stamina, and a Strength of 4.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Bunching- the mutant can add the skin's soak dice to his own
	against blunt force attacks by piling up extra skin in front of the
	impact zone.

Projective Empathy (Mental) [AL]
	Not a power to be taken lightly, Projective Empathy is the ability to
	spread your feelings around.  While this does not offer the control
	that telepathy does, it is more insidious, in some ways, since a
	well-timed projection is difficult to detect.  The aptly- named Lady
	Anguish has this power, as does the rather ill-named Psycho Man (in a
	technological variation).  Some mutants with this power can spread the
	emotions of others as well as their own- nasty if your group contains a
	brooder.  Roll Manipulation + Projective Empathy to determine the
	effectiveness of your assault (difficulty of the opponent's Willpower).
	The character is also eligible to buy the Empathy talent (on the
	character sheet), which is used in a number of Power Stunts.

	Special Flaw: Emotional Rollercoaster (3-point Flaw)- the mutant feels
	things far more strongly than other folks do.  When a particularly
	wonderful or horrible event occurs, the character must make a
	successful Willpower check (diff 8) or be overcome by that emotion. 
	Despair, fury, and euphoria are all paralyzing in terms of making
	rational decisions.  When you are exposed by Passive Empathy to an
	incredibly strong emotion, the same check must be made.

	Special Flaw: Involuntary Projection (2-point Flaw)- whenever the
	mutant botches a Willpower check or any mental power, he projects
	whichever emotion he is currently feeling, automatically.  When
	combined with Emotional Rollercoaster, this can be a bad time for all.

	¥ Broadcast your emotions over an area equal to 20 feet in radius. A
	successful Willpower check (difficulty equal to your Charisma + Empathy
	score, max 9) is required for your opponent to ignore the effect
	¥¥ Same deal, but the area is extended to a 100-foot radius.  Two
	successes are required to negate the effect within 20 feet, and one
	success beyond that.
	¥¥¥ Half-mile radius.  Three successes within 20 feet, two within 100
	feet, one beyond that.
	¥¥¥¥ 5-mile radius.  Four successes within 20 feet, three within 100
	feet, two within a half-mile, one beyond that.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 30-mile radius.  Five successes within 20 feet, four within 100
	feet, three within a half-mile, two within five miles, one beyond
	that.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Passive Empathy- the mutant can purchase the Power: Passive Empathy
	with Experience.
	¥ Single Target- the mutant can restrict the focus of her empathy to a
	single person within range, whether the emotions are positive or
	negative.
	¥¥ Subtle Manipulation- the projected emotion is automatically
	connected to a person, place or thing for each target, requiring them
	to make a Perception + Empathy roll (difficulty of the mutant's
	Manipulation + Empathy) to even notice the effect.  This roll will be
	required before a Willpower check can be made to resist the Power.
	¥¥¥ Ancient History- by making an Intelligence + Empathy roll, the
	mutant may dredge up one of her own memories associated with a
	particularly strong emotion, which may then be used with this Power.
	¥¥¥ Confidence- requires the Stunt: Subtle Manipulation.  The mutant
	may project confidence into a target, which will have the effect of
	decreasing difficulties for rolls related to their primary attribute
	category by one.
	¥¥¥ Dread- requires the Stunt: Subtle Manipulation.  By projecting fear
	or a related emotion on a target, the mutant can increase the target's
	difficulties for rolls related to their tertiary attribute category by
	one.
	¥¥¥ Old Memories- requires the Stunt: Suble Manipulation.  The emotion
	broadcast will tend to 'latch on' to appropriate memories related to
	that emotion to make them it effective. The number of successes
	required to resist is increased by one.  If the memory relates to a
	person that the victim is currently interacting with, the difficulty is
	raised by two.
	¥¥¥¥ Delirium- requires the Old Memories Stunt.  If the victim does not
	detect the manipulation or cannot dispel it, the memory that is being
	used returns as first-hand sensory experience.  If there are two
	victims sharing the same memory, this can set up some really strange
	situations.  A two-edged sword, since the mutant gets an Intelligence
	check (diff of the success roll of the empath) to realize that this
	should not be happening (and thus detect the manipulation).
	¥¥¥¥ Highs and Lows- requires the Stunt: Subtle Manipulation.  A target
	who does not realize he is being manipulated may have his dice pools
	related to any primary attribute category increased or decreased by
	the number of Willpower successes required to ignore the effect.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Despair- requires the Stunt: Ancient History.  The mutant may
	concentrate a negative emotion in a target so strongly with a
	successful projection that the target may not spend any points of an
	expendable advantage (Willpower, Rage, Power Charge, etc.) for the
	scene.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Power Recharge- requires the Stunt: Despair.  The mutant may
	concentrate a positive emotion to make all targets feel great.  For
	every point of expendable advantage (Willpower, Rage, etc.) that the
	mutant spends, her targets' same scores are recharged by one point.
	
	Passive Empathy/Projective Empathy Combination Power Stunts:
	¥/¥¥¥ Borrow Emotion- The mutant can 'borrow' the emotion of someone
	she has read and project it directly.  Perception + Empathy (diff 7) to
	borrow the emotion, and then a Manipulation + Proj. Empathy to
	broadcast.
	¥¥¥¥/¥¥¥¥ Confidence Boost- the mutant may purchase the Power:
	Confidence Boost with Experience.
	
	Telepathy/Projective Empathy Combination Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥/¥¥¥ Memory Implant- The mutant may install the 3-point Memory
	Implant flaw onto a particular target, requiring that the target has no
	temporary Willpower score.

Promethean Animation (Social) [AH]
	The ability to create a golem, a creature that can think and act, is the
	ability that this Power confers.  A golem is created out of non-living
	material (be it organic or inorganic), but the spark of life is added by
	its creator.  The Puppetmaster has this Power, which he combines with a
	sort of Metempsychosis to shunt his victims into the tiny puppets he
	creates.
	
	To create a temporary golem, the mutant first crafts its body.  It can
	be made from a variety of materials (anything from corpse parts to
	mystical clay), but it must be well-crafted (at least five successes on
	the relevant crafting ability check, be it Repair or Surgery or some
	variant of Crafting).  He then invests a point of Power Charge and a
	point of Willpower.  The Power Charge animates the golem, while the
	Willpower grants it some attributes.  One Willpower point offers the
	creature one point in each attribute.  Each additional point of
	Willpower spent will grant the creature three points of either
	Physical, Social, or Mental attributes.  When this Power is chosen, one
	such category is selected; the upper limit on the score of any
	attribute in this category is 15.  The cap on the other categories is
	five.  Note that there are size-related restrictions on some
	attributes; no six-inch tall puppet may have a Strength of 9.
	
	A golem created in this way will last one day for every success the
	mutant rolls on a Charisma + Promethean Animation roll (difficulty 7).
	The mutant may increase the lifespan of his creation from days to
	weeks, or weeks to months, by expending successive points of Power
	Charge.  The creation can be made permanent through the expenditure of
	a point of permanent Power Charge and another point of permanent
	Willpower.  The process of animation takes one round per point of
	Willpower or Power Charge being invested.
	
	The golem will obey its creator's commands willingly, having little
	personality of its own at the outset.  However, for each day that the
	golem lives, it gains one point of Willpower (to a maximum of the
	number of points the mutant spent in its creation).  Golems are
	sentient, and if ill-used, may well rebel.  Even under this
	circumstance, the power of the creator over his golem is strong.  Treat
	him as having an equivalent Rank of Voice of Command when giving his
	golems an order. Golems with no Willpower will unhesitatingly obey
	suicidal commands.
	
	All golems, whatever their size or composition, have a base of seven
	Health Levels.  They take no dice penalties until they reach the 
	equivalent of Crippled, whereupon they suffer the full -5 penalty.
	
	Special Merit: Breath of Life (2 points) - the mutant may spend
	Experience points to grant his golem abilities.  They must be abilities
	that he himself possesses.  These Experience points may only be spent
	at the time the golem is created (one point per dot of talent, skill,
	or knowledge) and the final score must be less than the creator's own. 
	That is, a mutant with a Brawl of 2, Tracking of 4, and Science of 1
	could pass along a Brawl of 1, Tracking of 3, and no Science at all.
	
	Special Flaw: One Medium (1-2 points) - like the Puppetmaster, the
	mutant is restricted in the material he can use to create a golem.  For
	two points, the material will be as rare or expensive as the mystical
	clay, found only in one country in eastern Europe, that the
	Puppetmaster must use.  For one point, the mutant is restricted to
	making only mechanical golems, or only golems made out of dead flesh.
	
	Note that mechanical or mystical golems may be imbued with special
	abilities (beyond that of normal golems) if their creator has access
	to the appropriate Powers (such as Hyper-Invention, Seeding, or
	Hedge Magick).
	
	¥ The mutant may have one golem under his command at any one time.
	¥¥ Two golems
	¥¥¥ Three golems
	¥¥¥¥ Four golems
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five golems

Psionic Collective (Mental) [AL]
	The Psionic Collective is a Power that must be taken by several
	characters who want to pool their Psychic resources.  It takes an
	action for a mutant with this power to merge into a psychic meld
	with another character, and as many as 100 people can join the
	Collective, if desired.  There are a few benefits to joining
	together in a Psionic Collective:
	
	* All the mutants in the Collective have a Psychic Defense equal
	to the highest score in that trait plus one Rank per five people
	(round up) in the Meld.
	* If two or more mutants share a Power like Telepathy, Projective
	Empathy, or Telekinesis, they each gain one Rank in the trait
	per five people (round up) in the Meld.
	* All the Willpower points that belong to the people in the
	Collective are joined together in a pool that can be accessed
	by everyone.  The points are divided evenly among the people
	after they leave the Meld (regardless of the score they had
	going in)- though they cannot, of course, exceed their
	Permanent Willpower in this way.
	* All physical actions are at +1 difficulty while in a meld.
	
	No roll is required.
	
	¥ The mutant has the capacity to join a Psionic Collective.

Psionic Furnace* (Mental) [AN]
	Not every mutant is cut out to house a psychic furnace.  It is an
	inexpressibly powerful source of psychic energy, which can be used
	for a variety of purposes- basically any sort of purely mental power
	that does not require a unique insight can evolve out of the psychic
	furnace.  Chamber of Generation X is a living psychic furnace- the
	power he can call upon allowed him to defeat Omega Red one-on-one.
	No roll is required.  In the case of Powers like Psychic Armour,
	which offer auto-successes, the mutant instead gets extra dice in
	the affected pools (in this case, soak dice).
	
	¥ Boost the effective damage potential or dice pool of all psychic
	powers by one.
	¥¥ Boost them by two
	¥¥¥ Boost them by three
	¥¥¥¥ Boost them by four
	¥¥¥¥¥ Boost them by five
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ One automatic 'six' rolled for all psychic powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Two automatic 'sixes'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Two automatic 'sevens'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Three automatic 'sevens'.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Three automatic 'eights'.
	
	Sample Power Stunts
	¥ Life Support- the mutant may purchase the Power: Life Support at
	half price with Experience or Freebies, even if he did not start
	the game with that Power.
	¥¥ Hot Flash- When the mutant is struck with a cutting edge, his
	psionic furnace releases psionic flame which inflicts Rank damage
	(diff 9 to soak, aggravated) against the aggressor.
	¥¥ Buy Telepathy, Telekinesis, Combat Telepathy, Psychic Armour,
	Psychic Blast, Psychic Backlash, Psychic Field,  Tech Telepathy,
	Detection of most sorts, Clairaudience, Animal Telepathy, Psychic
	Weaponry, Projective Empathy, or Clairvoyance with Experience
	points, even if the mutant did not start the game with these powers.
	The mutant may develop one of these Powers _per Rank_ in this Power.
	That is, if Jon Starsmore develops Projective Empathy when he 
	reaches Psionic Furnace ¥¥, he must wait until the third Rank before
	he develops Technological Telepathy as a stunt.
	¥¥¥ Psionic Energy Emission- buy Energy Emission (Psionic Flame)*
	with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Psionic Energy Body*- this power stunt costs a full 5 Willpower
	points even to start developing, and a further 5 Willpower to cement,
	before the Energy Body (Psionic Flame)* can be purchased.  This Power
	works much like the Energy Body power, but is powered by the mutant's
	psionic furnace.  Nasty, to say the least.

Psionic Vibration (Mental) [AL]
	A rarely encountered Power, a mutant endowed with this ability finds
	herself able to create vibrations using the power of her mind.  She
	does this by setting up controlled resonance vibrations at the
	molecular level. Unlike a pyrokinetic, she does not use the excited
	molecules to create fires, however.  Instead, the target finds itself
	trying to simultaneously shake apart in all directions. 
	
	Intelligence + Psionic Vibration, diff. 6 for non-living targets, diff.
	7 for living targets.  Non-living, stationary targets do not get a roll
	to soak the damage.  Non-living but mobile targets take only half the
	listed damage.  Force fields, energy constructs etc. and living targets
	all get their normal soak roll.  All direct damage is treated as lethal
	damage. 
	
	Special Flaw: Sympathetic Tremors (2 point Flaw): This flaw causes the
	mutant's body to shake whenever he uses this Power. T o an observer, it
	might appear as if he is suffering from some sort of slight palsy.  All
	Dexterity related tasks are at +1 difficulty.  Similar to Taxing Power,
	the mutant may use this power for a number of rounds equal to his
	Stamina. After that, he loses one point from his Dexterity for each
	round beyond the limit.  If he falls to zero Dexterity, he passes out
	for a number of (10 - Stamina) rounds.

	¥ 2 Health Levels of damage to non-living targets.  1 level of damage
	to force fields and energy constructs.  No damage to living targets. 
	Range: 100 feet.
	¥¥ 4 Health Levels to non-living targets.  2 levels of damage to force
	fields, energy constructs etc.  No damage to living targets.  Range:
	200 feet.
	¥¥¥ 6 Health Levels to non-living targets.  4 levels of damage to force
	fields, energy constructs etc.  3 Health Levels of damage to living
	targets.  Range: 300 feet
	¥¥¥¥ 8 Health Levels to non-living.  6 levels to force fields, energy
	constructs etc.  4 Health Levels to living targets.  Range: 400 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 10 Health Levels to non-living.  8 levels to force fields, energy
	constructs etc.  5 Health Levels to living targets.  Range: 500 feet.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Hard Rain: The mutant targets an area above the heads of her
	opponents, shaking it apart.  This does one Health Level of damage per
	success.  The Storyteller determines what type of damage is taken
	depending on the material used.
	¥¥ Resonance Shield [AH]: By carefully vibrating the air molecules
	around him, the mutant is capable of forming a temporary barrier.  One
	soak die per successes on the roll.  The shield lasts for as long as
	the mutant concentrates, but if it ever takes more damage in a single
	hit than there were successes on the original roll, it collapses.
	¥¥¥¥ Discrete Demolition: This stunt is extremely difficult (diff. 9)
	but highly effective.  It targets a smaller section of the victim, such
	as a hand or eye.  It does only half normal damage, (round down) but is
	difficulty 8 to soak.  Depending on how much, and where, damage is
	taken, the Storyteller may wish to assign secondary effects or
	penalties.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Fire it Up: The mutant is now able to excite the structure of a
	target in a way that if left uncontrolled, will cause it to burst into
	flames.  Diff. 8, and the victim gets to make a Stamina roll.  If the
	mutant gets more successes, the target bursts into flames; this
	inflicts normal Rank damage for the Power, plus half Rank in damage for
	a number of rounds equal to the number of successes the mutant won the
	opposed roll by.

Psiskinning (Mental) [AH]
	Psiskinning is a blessedly rare ability, since it is both invasive and
	unpleasant.  A victim of a psiskinning will be forced to relive his
	most unpleasant and fearsome memories, frequently with the forcible
	imposition of the skinner into those memories.  This can actually
	drain Willpower and cause damage (from hemorrhaging in the brain). 
	The Black Queen of the Hellfire Club of London and the Soul Skinner
	have abilities that are related to psiskinning.  The system is
	comparison of the mutant's Intelligence + Psiskinning to the victim's
	Willpower (contested rolls). The victim either loses (or,
	infrequently) gains Willpower points equal to the difference in
	successes between the two rolls.  The victim also loses Health Levels
	equal to the margin by which he was defeated by the mutant.  No one
	can lose more Health Levels to Psiskinning than he has Willpower.

	¥ The mutant can perform a psiskinning, causing loss of Willpower and
	Health if successful.  The difficulty is 7; the victim saves on a 
	difficulty of 6.
	¥¥ The difficulty is reduced to 6.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can cause the surrounding area and stimuli to fade
	into relative insignificance; the skinning overlays the victim's
	perceptions completely.  The mutant will not feel damage taken to
	his real body, except via this Power's effects.  The mutant will
	continue to move in the real world as if his hallucinations were
	real.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can temporarily drain Wits using Psiskinning, as
	well.  The victim's maximum Wits score, for purposes of this Power's
	effects, is equal to his current Willpower.  As the victim's will
	regenerates itself, so too will his Wits.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can cause the victim to be paralyzed while the
	inner battle takes place; the difficulty is reduced to 5.

Psychic Armour (Mental) [AL]
	The mutant has the ability to create armour out of his own thought.
	She spends a point of Willpower and summons the armour, which can
	take practically any outward form and has a defensive ability that
	is based on the mutant's Power Rank.  This armour does not restrict
	movement, and increases the difficulty of mind-affecting attacks
	against the mutant, as well (maximum difficulty of 10).  No other
	psychic powers can be employed while this ability is functioning.
	
	¥ One automatic soak, +1 difficulty to mind attacks.
	¥¥ Two automatic soak, +1 difficulty to mind attacks.
	¥¥¥ Three automatic soak, +2 difficulty to mind attacks.
	¥¥¥¥ Four automatic soak, +2 difficulty to mind attacks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five automatic soak, +3 difficulty to mind attacks.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six automatic soak, +3 difficulty to mind attacks, subtract
	one success from mind attacks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven automatic soak, +4 difficulty to mind attacks,
	subtract two successes from mind attacks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight automatic soak, +4 difficulty to mind attacks,
	subtract three successes from mind attacks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine automatic soak, +5 difficulty to mind attacks,
	subtract four successes from mind attacks
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten automatic soak, invulnerability to mind attacks

Psychic Backlash (Mental) [AN]
	The mutant has a formidable natural defense against psychic attacks
	of all sorts, even simple mind probes.  Any psychic probe or
	attack mounted against the mutant causes a painful reaction in the
	brain of the instigator.  This is an instinctive reaction, and
	does not require concentration.  Rank one attacks automatically
	initiate the response detailed in the first level of this power,
	even if the mutant possessing this power is rank three- the greater
	the power of the psychic attack, the greater the backlash.  So, a
	Rank two attack against a mutant with a Rank three Psychic Backlash
	suffers the effects of a Rank two backlash and the attack will fail,
	while a Rank four attack against the same mutant would suffer a Rank
	three backlash (the maximum that the mutant's defenses allow) and
	the power would not necessarily fail.  This power does not work
	against Telekinesis.  Dice penalties last until the psychic gets
	a good night's sleep or supernatural healing.  No roll is required.
	
	¥ The offending psychic must soak one Health level of damage and
	suffers from a splitting headache.  If this was a Rank one attack
	or power, it automatically fails.
	¥¥ The psychic must soak one Health level of damage and the headache
	that follows inflicts a -1 dice penalty.  If the power was Rank two,
	it fails.
	¥¥¥ The psychic must soak two Health levels of damage and the pain
	is so excruciating that the offender must make a Willpower check 
	at difficulty 7 or lose consciousness.  In any case, the ensuing
	headache inflicts a -1 dice penalty, and if the power was Rank three,
	it does not work.
	¥¥¥¥ The psychic must soak two Health levels of damage- the resulting
	pain forces him to make a Willpower check at difficulty 8 or lose
	consciousness.  The headache that follows is worth a -2 dice penalty,
	and any Rank four power will fail.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The psychic is forced to soak three Health levels of damage.
	The wilting force of the backlash forces the psychic to make a Willpower
	check at difficulty 9 or lose consciousness, and a second check must
	be made (difficulty 9) to avoid temporary feeblemindedness (all Mental
	Stats and Temporary Willpower are reduced to 1, no mental powers can
	be used), which lasts until the psychic gets a good night's sleep.  In
	any case, the ensuing headache is worth a -3 dice penalty, and any
	Rank five power will fail.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Lower defenses- the mutant can consciously choose to tear down the
	Psychic Backlash temporarily.  This requires light concentration.
	¥¥¥ Painful Suggestion- requires Telepathy.  This allows the mutant
	to sneak a suggestion or thought into the attacking telepath's mind,
	using the Backlash as a sort of carrier wave.  Suggestions sent in
	in this fashion (requires an action) are at +2 difficulty to resist.

Psychic Blast (Mental) [AL]
	The nasty version of Telepathy, the Psychic Blast allows a mutant to
	mount an all-out assault on a target being's mind, laying it waste and
	delivering some damage.  While this may not be as physically damaging
	as an energy blast, the collateral damage associated with it can be
	even more harmful.  This attack can be resisted using the Temporary
	Willpower score, which nullifies all of the secondary effects of that
	attack (non-damaging portions) if it succeeds (difficulty 6, like a
	soak roll- requires as many successes as the attacker rolled for the
	Blast).  Of course, one of the effects of the Psychic Blast is to sap
	the Willpower...  Psylocke's Psychic Knife is an example (albeit a
	weird one) of a Psychic Blast.  Roll Dexterity + Directed Blast to
	hit.
	
	¥ No damage, -2 dice penalty for next round.
	¥¥ One Health Level of damage, -2 dice penalty for 2 rounds, make
	a Willpower check (diff 6) or lose a Temporary point of Willpower
	¥¥¥ Two Health Levels of damage, -3 dice penalty for 4 rounds, make
	a Willpower check (diff 7) or lose 2 Temporary points of Willpower
	¥¥¥¥ Three Health Levels of damage, -2 dice penalty for a scene, make
	a Willpower check (diff 8) or lose 3 Temporary points of Willpower
	and lose a point of Wits for the scene.  Stamina check (diff 6) to
	remain conscious.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels of damage, -3 dice penalty for a scene, make
	a Willpower check (diff 9) or lose 4 Temporary points of Willpower
	and lose 2 points of Wits for the scene.  Stamina check (diff 7) to
	remain conscious.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Visceral Blast- like Psylocke's Knife, the mutant can focus 
	the Blast into a knife- or sword-like psychic energy, which allows
	her to use her Melee score instead of Directed Blast when attacking
	with this power.
	¥¥ Replay Memories- the Blast can activate memories, which may be
	painful or distracting depending on the circumstances.  Roll
	Manipulation + Psychic Blast (diff 7).
	¥¥¥ Erase Memories- the Blast can also temporarily remove many
	of the target's memories.  This will randomly affect the mind
	of the target; its effects cannot be controlled.  It can cut off
	the character's access to a Knowledge, a Skill, or a particular
	piece of info for one scene.  Roll Manipulation + Psychic Blast
	(diff of the target's Willpower + 3).
	¥¥¥ Replay Pain- the Blast can duplicate the feel of the most painful
	moment in the mutant's experience- the character is hit with as much
	'shadow damage' as he has suffered in the most physically damaging
	assault in his life.  This damage is imaginary, but the dice penalties
	and cumulative effects are similar.  If the mutant does not soak enough
	of this damage to stay conscious, or is later rendered unconscious, this
	'shadow damage' will be gone when he wakes up, and will disappear at
	the end of the scene in any case.  Diff of the target's Willpower
	plus three (Charisma + Psychic Blast).
	¥¥¥¥ Shatter Mind- the Blast can rend the mind of the victim and tear
	it into shards- at best, the poor fool will be in a degenerate animal
	state; at worst, she will sit and drool.  If the mutant scores more
	successes to hit with the attack than the victim has Intelligence,
	then the victim will be unable to take any rational action of any
	kind (or indeed, form a thought) for one scene.  With the expenditure
	of a permanent Willpower point on the part of the mutant, this
	condition can be made permanent(!), requiring psychic surgery to
	reverse.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Autonomic Assault- the Blast can also disrupt the proper 
	function of the victim's autonomic nervous system- the one that
	regulates heartbeat, breathing, etc.  The mutant, when she hits,
	must spend a point of Willpower.  The victim must then soak one 
	additional Health Level of damage per Rank in this Power.

Psychic Bolt (Mental) [AL]
	The most damaging mental Power, the Psychic Bolt is a form of
	Telekinesis that does not require much in the way of concentration. Of
	course, it also does not allow much in the way of subtlety.  It
	operates strictly as a damaging blast similar in some ways to Energy
	Emission: Energy Force, in that it contains a strong tactile element,
	but it also contains a brain-scrambling psychic energy.  Requires a
	Dexterity + Directed Blast roll to hit.  Psychic bolts do not inflict
	aggravated damage.  Note that if the victim possesses the Power:
	Psychic Defense, he will not suffer from the increase in difficulty.
	
	¥ Two Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥ Three Health Levels of damage plus +1 difficulty to actions next
	round.
	¥¥¥ Four Health Levels of damage plus +2 difficulty to actions next
	round.
	¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels of damage plus +3 difficulty to actions next
	round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Seven Health Levels of damage plus +4 difficulty to actions
	the following round.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Eight Health Levels of damage, +4 difficulty to actions next
	round, and an additional -1 die penalty for a scene.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine Health Levels of damage, +4 difficulty, -2 dice penalty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Ten Health Levels of damage, +4 difficulty, -3 dice penalty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Eleven Health Levels of damage, +5 diff, -4 dice penalty.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twelve Health Levels of damage, +5 diff, -5 dice penalty.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Slug- the mutant can target specific parts of the victim's body
	at difficulty 9, and add her successes to the damage.

Psychic Defense (Mental) [PL]
	This Power gives mutants who may not have any other psychic abilities
	the power to resist telepathic commands, psi-scans, and psychic blasts
	of all varieties.  This score augments the Willpower when the mutant
	would be allowed to use it to defend against a power of this sort, or
	acts in its stead when it would not be useful.  Telepaths have a sort
	of psychic defense, but it is an active one which requires awareness
	and light concentration- this Power is completely unconscious and, for
	the most part, involuntary.  Gambit and Magneto both have significant
	psychic defenses.   No roll is normally required.  Note also that in
	the case of such Powers as Psychic Backlash or Psychic Bolt, the mutant
	may use this Power as extra soak dice OR to protect her from its
	secondary effects.
	
	¥ One die is added to psychic defense pool
	¥¥ Two dice
	¥¥¥ Three dice
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Five dice + one auto-success
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Six dice + one auto-success
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Six dice + two auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Seven dice + two auto-successes
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Seven dice + three auto-successes

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Detect Psychic Probe- the mutant can detect any attempt to probe
	or attack or alter his mind and act accordingly.  On a successful
	Perception + Psychic Defense roll, he can determine the source of
	this attack.
	¥ Lower Defenses- the mutant may voluntarily choose not to resist
	telepathic attacks or probes.
	¥¥ Enter Mindscape- If a telepath enters the Mindscape of a mutant
	with psychic defense, the mutant can choose to let him in and lie
	in wait for that telepath...
	¥¥¥ Hard Target- the difficulty to affect the mutant with any psychic
	Power can be increased by one per Rank with the expenditure of a point
	of Willpower.

Psychic Field (Mental) [AL]
	This is a variation on the Force Field that employs psychic energy
	to protect the character instead of a more 'physical' variety.  While
	it is effective against physical, energy, AND psionic attacks (thus
	it protects against a wider variety of attacks than a typical force
	field does), it is a construct of the mutant's mind and the backlash
	that results from having the field breached can be crippling.  The
	Acolyte Unuscione has an unusually powerful variant of the Psychic
	Field, which she calls a Psychic Exoskeleton.
	
	The character rolls Intelligence + Psychic Field to determine how many
	soak dice vs. psionic attacks that the Psychic Field possesses.  In any
	case, it has a Strength and Stamina equal to the mutant's Permanent
	Willpower (so a Strength 2 character is probably not going to push his
	way through a Psychic Field erected by a character with a Willpower of
	7).  The field has a number of Health Levels equal to the rating of the
	Psychic Field, and once the last Health Level is gone, the Field drops.
	The mutant suffers from the equivalent dice penalties, as if she had
	taken the damage that her field sustained, for the rest of the scene if
	the field is destroyed.  If the mutant would have been rendered
	Incapacitated or dead by that damage, she loses consciousness.
	
	¥ One Health Level
	¥¥ Two Health Levels
	¥¥¥ Three Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen Health Levels
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen Health Levels
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Psychic Impression- requires the Psychic Impression power.  Any
	object that touches the field will immediately be 'read' by the
	mutant whether or not it penetrates the field.
	¥¥¥ Mind Link- requires the Telepathy power.  Any person who touches
	the field will automatically have their mind opened to the Field
	holder, unless he has telepathic defenses.
	¥¥¥ Willpower Healing- the mutant can expend points of Willpower to
	heal damage to the field on a one-for-one basis.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Psychic Exoskeleton- the mutant can control the shape of the
	Field and use it to grapple and crush characters- the mutant uses
	her Wits + Psychic Field to hit, and her Willpower as the Strength
	of the Exoskeleton for attack purposes.

Psychic Illusions (Mental) [AH]
	A power that was possessed both by Mirage of the New Mutants and by
	the younger Mastermind, Psychic Illusions operate only in the minds
	of their targets, and do not possess any sort of phenomenal being,
	as normal illusions do.  This makes them at once more effective
	(since the target's mind takes the concept and then actually
	constructs the image itself) and less effective (since psychic
	defenses dampen them, and two people frequently do not see the same
	image).  True power with this ability comes when the mutant can
	affect more than one person; in any case, Psychic Illusions always
	affect all of the senses.  Manipulation + Psychic Illusions (diff
	of the opponent's Intelligence + Alertness).
	
	Variation: Empathic Illusions- instead of being telepathic, the
	ability is based on empathy.  The mutant merely attempts to evoke
	a certain emotion in the target, and the target's mind builds an
	appropriate image.  Mirage had this variation, which she used to
	terrify her enemies.
	
	¥ Affect one person at a time
	¥¥ Affect two people
	¥¥¥ Five people
	¥¥¥¥ Ten people
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anyone within visual range

Psychic Impressions (Mental) [AH]
	This ability allows the mutant to 'read' an inanimate object (of
	organic or inorganic matter) and pick up psychic residue from it
	which usually takes the form of a memory of recent events (or
	ones that are highly charged with emotion or psychic energy of
	some kind).  Often, either a brief flash of a scene or a particular
	emotion will be the form that this power takes.  The mutant has
	no control over what form the info takes, if he gets any at all;
	he can only choose when to activate this ability.
	
	¥¥ Read object- roll Perception + Psychic Impressions to see if you
	pick anything up (if there is anything there, that is)
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Last minute- the mutant can 'replay' the last minute in the life
	of a recently deceased corpse by touching it, experiencing exactly
	what happened to the person.

Psychic Invulnerability (Mental) [AN]
	This deadly power makes the mutant in question totally immune to
	telepathic attacks, though his mind can be read, and existing
	memory implants, etc. are not erased.  Psychic blasts echo
	emptily and his mind cannot be dominated or forcibly changed using
	Telepathy, Mind magick, or any related ability.  This is a Rank
	Four power, and it cannot be improved in any way.  The mutant
	may have no other mental powers (ESP, TP, TK, Confidence Boost,
	Hedge Magick, or other powers that rely on the strength of the mind)
	if he has this power.  Sabretooth has a weak form of this power-
	Spiral's version is more robust.  No roll is required.
	
	¥¥¥¥ All psychic attacks automatically fail, doing no damage.

Psychic Link (Mental) [AL]
	This power, known most popularly in the Marvel Universe to Cyclops
	and Phoenix, merely creates a link between the minds of the two
	power holders.  This allows telepathic communication, and you can
	always recognize the other holder of the power (no imposters will
	do!)  Strongly felt emotions may cross the barrier without any
	concentration or intent.  This link typically does not function
	across dimensional barriers.  In order for this power to work,
	two (or more) mutants must purchase it.  Normally, no roll is
	required.
	
	* All difficulties to affect the person(s) at the other end of
	the link with Empathy are at -3.
	* All difficulties to affect the person(s) at the other end of
	the link with Telepathy or other psychic assaults are at -2.
	* The difficulty to detect a Psychic Link using Telepathy, or
	to 'listen in' on a conversation is at +3 (max of 10).
	
	¥ Link Established
	
	¥ Variant- Link with object
	This version of the Psychic Link pairs the mutant with a item such
	as a sword, rather than with another person.  This can include objects
	gleaned from the Equipment background.  This has a number of useful
	effects:
	
	* The mutant always knows where the weapon is.
	* If someone picks up the weapon, the mutant immediately knows.
	* All Melee rolls are at -1 difficulty with the weapon.
	
	If the link is with an object such as a car, the difficulties for the
	Drive skill are at -1 with that car.  Any object that is used with a
	particular skill can benefit from a similar reduction when the mutant
	has a psychic link with it.

	¥ Variant- Link with location
	An unusual variation.  The mutant's awareness is tied to a specific
	place.  This place might be a room, or a patch of land.  The Hulk has
	a weak Psychic Link with the place where he had his original gamma
	radiation accident.  A link with a location has a few useful effects:
	
	* The mutant immediately knows when someone enters or leaves the
	location
	* The mutant can communicate with any person in that location as if he
	were talking on a telepathic telephone- surface thoughts only, no
	probing.
	* The mutant can always find the location, no matter how lost he is,
	and can get an idea where he is in reference to it.  This only functions
	when the mutant is in the same dimension, of course.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Share the Will- if the mutant's partner is in trouble, she may
	elect to perform this desperate and draining Power Stunt, which
	sends one point of Temporary Willpower across the Psychic Link for
	every PERMANENT point spent by the sender.  This Willpower may be
	restored with Experience.
	¥ Pain Attenuation- the mutant may elect to open his mind to his
	partner in an attempt to lessen her pain.  All dice penalties are
	added together and divided evenly between the two, rounding up.
	Stamina + Psychic Link, diff 7.
	¥ One Mind- this stunt allows the mutants to mingle their minds
	together, which may irretrievably mesh their personalities.  The
	highest Mental and Social Attributes from each character are shared
	by both, as well as the highest score in each Ability.  All things
	(memories, thoughts) are shared when in One Mind, and the mutants
	can only stay safely meshed for one round per Willpower point of
	the mutant with the weakest will.  After that, a Willpower check
	(difficulty starts at 6) is required when they try to unmesh, and
	this difficulty increases by one per round.  Once the diff reaches
	eleven, the mutants cannot separate their minds properly.  The
	effects of this are up to the Storyteller.
	¥ Create Temporary Link*- the mutant can create temporary Psychic
	Links with people, places, or things (depending on the variant
	that he has) which last for one scene.  This requires the
	expenditure of a Willpower point.  Fixx and Mastermind had this
	Stunt. [AH]
	¥ Thought Colony- requires One Mind.  A mutant with a Psychic Link
	who dies may 'jump' across the link and take up residence in the
	head of the other mutant.  If they are both willing, and they both
	succeed a Willpower check (diff 9, 3 successes each), then the 
	mutant whose body is being 'borrowed' is considered to have the
	power Alter Ego, with the mind of the other mutant as one of the
	personalities.  If either check fails, then the effects are as in
	'One Mind' above.
	¥ Distance Judgment- the relative power of the link can tell either
	mutant how far apart the other is, in a rough sort of way.  Certainly,
	the link seems to increase in intensity as the other approaches.
	Perception + Psychic Link, diff 6.
	¥ Surroundings Sense- the mutant can 'read' the surroundings of
	the other person, getting a brief, idealized, and hazy picture from
	the other person's mind.  The range of this power varies with the
	Willpower of the two people, and the vividity of the picture depends
	upon the other person's degree of familiarity with it.  Perception +
	Psychic Link, diff 7.

Psychic Template (Mental) [AH]
	A very curious (but highly useful) Power, this enables the mutant to
	'copy' the mind of a neighbouring person (within 10 feet) and then
	'paste' this copy into a small compartment into his own head.  He
	can then use his Willpower to try to overcome this mental template
	and learn everything that it knows.  This mental template is, in
	most respects, identical to the original mind.  This does not include
	Powers like Telepathy (though Psychic Defenses, including those that
	come built-in with Telepathy, do cross over), but certainly the
	template has the same Willpower, and if the original mind had Iron
	Will, then the template does, as well.  Beware of making a copy of
	the wrong mind... Telepathic Indetectibility and Psychic
	Invulnerability defeat this Power, but otherwise it is very hard to
	detect, and thus even telepaths can have their minds 'copied' unless
	they are vigilant, all unawares.  The mutant may 'purge' the new
	mind whenever he pleases.  Engaging this Power requires a Wits +
	Psychic Template roll (diff 6).
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant can take a psychic 'snapshot' of a person's mind,
	and then can engage in a contest of Willpower (diff 6 for each,
	whoever loses each round loses a point of Willpower until it is
	all gone and one person can no longer resist).  Strange minds (like
	those of sentient plants, or aliens, or spirits) may be harder to
	dominate.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Perfect Copy- requires the Powers: Shapeshifting or Physical
	Imitation.  The mutant can make an absolutely flawless copy,
	complete with voice and mannerisms, by 'raiding' a template of
	the person.
	¥¥¥ Probe Weaknesses- requires the Powers: Telepathy or Psychic
	Blast.  Once the mutant has raided the template, telepathic 
	attacks on the original are at -1 difficulty.
	¥¥¥ New Tenant- requires the Power: Alter Ego.  This isn't such
	a good Stunt to have.  The 'template', if it spends three points
	of Willpower, can permanently set up shop as a new personality
	in the mutant's head.  Oops.  A mutant with both of these Powers
	is assumed to have this 'Stunt' for free.

Psychic Tracking (Mental) [AL]
	"I feel a tremor in the Force.  A presence I have not felt since..."
	Your mutant, like the inexpressibly nasty Cyber, has the Power to
	'feel' the psychic signatures of people and recognize them later,
	even tracking them down by following the vague disturbances that
	the person leaves in the psychic plane.  It is awfully difficult
	to hide from someone with Psychic Tracking.  A Perception +
	Psychic Tracking roll (diff 4) can be made when the mutant first
	meets a person to get her 'scent'.  Telepathic Indetectibility and
	Telepathic Interference prevent this outright.
	
	¥¥¥ Nobody can hide from you, short of having his mind's texture
	radically changed.  If they are anywhere on Earth, you can chase
	him down, knowing when the trail is getting warm and cold.  Only
	the psychically invisible, folks with Alter Egos, and people who
	have their minds wiped can fool you on a regular basis.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Imitation- requires Telepathy ¥¥¥.  Your character, once he has
	'felt' a person's psychic signature, can fool telepaths into thinking
	that he is that person by laying her psychic signature atop his own
	in his mind.  Tricky when combined with Physical Imitation.

Psychic Vampirism (Mental) [PL]
	This power forces your character to prey on your fellow humans and
	other supernatural beings, but it gives a powerful advantage.  The
	mutant does not need to eat, but instead gains sustenance from the
	Willpower of others- he can heal a Health Level by absorbing the
	Temporary Willpower of his victims.  Unfortunately, the character
	loses a Health Level every day that he does not feed on Willpower.
	This craving can be staved off by feeding yourself with your own
	Willpower, but you might go into a feeding frenzy if you spend your
	last one.  This power can be resisted by people with Telepathy,
	Mind Magic, or other psychic defenses, but everyone else is pretty
	much screwed.  The Black Queen, Selene, is a psychic vampire.
	The mutant must be touching her victim.
	
	¥ Absorb one point of Willpower per round.
	¥¥ Two points
	¥¥¥ Three points
	¥¥¥¥ Four points
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Regain Willpower- rather than channel the Willpower of your
	enemies into Health, you can channel it into your own Willpower
	score, if it is depleted.
	¥¥¥¥ Slave- any being drained of all temporary Willpower by a mutant
	with Psychic Vampirism must obey all the commands of that vampire
	until he regains at least one Willpower point. [AL]

	Variation: Empathic Vampirism (Social)- instead of feeding on the
	Willpower of others, your character feeds on emotions.  The mutant must
	still touch her victim, but gains one Health Level for a round of
	contact with a strong emotion.  For every Rank by which the mutant
	exceeds the minimum for absorbing such an emotion, an extra Health
	Level may be transferred.  For example, a Rank three Empathic Vampire
	encountering a person feeling the most profound jealousy (Rank one
	effect) gains three Health Levels.  When this feeding occurs, the
	victim no longer feels that emotion for the rest of the day.  Empathic
	Resistance protects reduces the effective Rank of this Power on a
	Rank-for-Rank basis (i.e., a target with Rank two Empathic Resistance
	is immune to the effects of Rank one or two Empathic Vampirism, and
	a Rank three Empathic Vampire may only feed on blinding anger, bliss,
	etc.)
	
	Special Flaw: Blank (2 pt. Flaw)- you have lost the ability to feel
	emotions yourself, and may only experience them when you have been
	in contact recently.  Draining jealousy allows you to feel jealousy
	for that scene.  All difficulties for social interaction are at +3,
	and Empathy rolls automatically fail.
	
	¥ Blinding anger, bliss, the blackest envy or jealousy, and suicidal
	depression can be drained using this Power.
	¥¥ Wrath, joy, jealousy, and sorrow, etc. can be drained using this
	Power.
	¥¥¥ Anger, happiness, sadness, etc. can be drained at this Rank.
	¥¥¥¥ Strong annoyance, frustration, and other emotions of this nature
	can be drained.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mild annoyance, amusement, disapproval, and the like can be
	drained.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Rage- a target with Rage may be drained of one point of Rage per
	round.
	¥¥ Dull Frenzy- requires the Stunt: Rage.  A sentient being (mutant,
	vampire, werewolf) in a frenzy can be restored to reason at a touch,
	though in the case of a vampire's feeding frenzy, it may resume as
	soon as contact is broken.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Dull Spirit- the target can not spend Willpower, due to the lack
	of emotions.

Psychic Weaponry (Mental) [AL]
	The ability to focus your mind into a physical weapon and use it to
	injure an opponent is a Power much to be feared.  The mutant simply
	spends a Willpower point and either creates the weapon out of whole
	cloth, or psychically empowers a favorite weapon.  Senyaka of the
	Acolytes had this Power.  One specific weapon type must be chosen.
	Basically, the weapon has a physical form that is wreathed in highly
	destructive Psionic Flame.
	
	¥ The weapon's damage is aggravated.
	¥¥ The weapon inflicts an extra point of damage.
	¥¥¥ The weapon drains a point of Willpower on a successful hit unless
	the target has some sort of psychic defense.
	¥¥¥¥ The weapon inflicts another extra point of damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The weapon's damage can only be soaked by characters with some
	sort of psychic defense (Psychic Armour, Psychic Defenses, the level
	one Telepathic ability Shield Mind, etc.).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Psychic Impression- requires the Psychic Impression power.  Any
	object that touches the weapon will immediately be 'read' by the
	mutant whether or not it takes damage.  Perception + Psychic
	Weaponry.
	¥¥¥ Mind Link- requires the Telepathy power.  Any person who touches
	the weapon will automatically have their mind opened to the Weapon
	holder, unless he has telepathic defenses.

Puppetry (Physical) [AH]
	The closest thing that most Physical characters can get to Telepathy
	or Voice of Command is Puppetry, which is possessed by Copycat of the
	Deviants (Wildstorm, not Marvel).  This is the Power to create a link
	between the mutant's body and another person's.  The mutant then moves
	in any way that she desires, and the body of the "puppet" will move in
	the same fashion.  This Power requires a Stamina + Puppetry roll (diff
	7) to create a link, but does not require any concentration on the
	part of the mutant once the link is established.  This roll is
	resisted by a Willpower roll (diff 6) on the part of the target.  The
	character with the higher number of successes prevails.  A link may be
	severed by the puppeteer at any time.  The puppet can attempt to sever
	the link by spending a Willpower point, in which case the contested
	roll is made again.  If the puppeteer loses consciousness, he loses
	control over his puppet.

	¥ The mutant can turn people of roughly her size (within 20 pounds of
	weight) and physiology into puppets.  Opposite sex puppetry is
	impossible (wait for Rank two).  Strange body armour, life support
	powers, etc. can make puppetry attempts at this Rank impossible.
	¥¥ The mutant can turn people of the same species and size (within 50
	pounds of weight) into puppets.  Normal humans are considered to be of
	the same species as mutants.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can turn humanoids of roughly the same size (within 100
	pounds of weight) into puppets.  They must at least be of similar
	origin (both carbon-based animal life forms).  Extra limbs and the
	like still disqualify Puppetry attempts.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can turn humanoids of roughly the same shape and size
	(within 200 pounds of weight) into puppets.  They must at least be of
	similar origin.  Extra limbs, etc., increase the difficulty by one per
	aberration.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can turn humanoids of roughly the same size (within
	500 pounds of weight) into puppets.  They must at least be carbon-
	based (assuming the mutant is carbon-based).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Multi-tasking- the mutant can spend a Willpower point and make a
	Stamina + Puppetry roll (diff 9), resisted in the usual way, to
	attempt to make a second or third person into a puppet.  Any number of
	victims can be held in this way at one time, though any failure to
	establish a ruling relationship by the puppeteer allows his puppets a
	chance to escape at the same difficulty.

Pyrokinesis (Mental) [AH]
	This Power, which has been manifested by such notables as Typhoid Mary, 
	Legion, and the Man-Thing, allows a mutant to start fires using his 
	mind.  This requires considerable concentration (similar to the level 
	required by Telekinesis or Telepathy) but no attack roll is required 
	(as is needed for Energy Emission: Fire, which is a similar Power). 
	The mutant merely concentrates, and heat is generated. If the object 
	under attack is flammable, it may burst into flame.  Use Intelligence +
	Pyrokinesis (diff 6).

	¥ One Health Level of heat damage per round can be generated.
	¥¥ One Health Level of damage on the first round, two on each subsequent 
	round.
	¥¥¥ One Health level the first round, two the second round, and three 
	on all subsequent rounds.
	¥¥¥¥ Four damage on the fourth round and those that follow.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five damage on the fifth round and those that follow.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Two damage on the first round, max of six.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Three damage on the first round, max of seven.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Four damage on the first round, max of eight.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Five damage on the first round, max of ten.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Six damage on the first round, no maximum.

	If the mutant loses her concentration, she must begin the process of 
	heating the object again.  The chance of lighting an object on fire
	(assuming it is flammable) is (nine - Rank), so on the first round, a 
	mutant with Pyrokinesis ¥¥¥ would roll one die, and the object would 
	burst into flame on an eight. On the second round, the mutant would 
	have two dice to roll, and the difficulty would be only seven. On the 
	third round, three dice and diff six.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Extinguish flames- the mutant can also attempt to put out fires. 
	A Bic lighter flame would be a difficulty three roll, while a house 
	fire would be difficulty nine, and a chemical fire of any size would 
	be difficulty 10.
	¥¥ Cold Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Power: Energy
	Resistance (Cold) with Experience.
	¥¥¥ Elf Fire- the mutant can limn a target with pseudo-flames that 
	are very cold (for a flame) at the base, and that do not cause burns. 
	This requires considerable concentration (difficulty 8). The flames 
	are still hot at the tips, and will inflict one Health Level of damage 
	to flammable materials that come into contact with them (like flesh). 
	They are not real flames, and do not require fuel to exist.

Quintessence Field (Social) [AH]
	Through the virtue of intense concentration, the hero can surround
	himself with a brief, cataclysmic field of the pure energy that makes
	up all things.  This is not the gentle, aura-soluble quintessence that
	mages tame so readily, but rather the cleansing energy that is Prime. 
	The field extends one quarter of an inch from the mutant's body. 
	Activation of the field (and its maintenance, round by round) costs a
	point of Willpower.  This energy is difficulty 8 to soak.
	
	¥ The mutant is immune to magic while the field is on (unravelling
	any enchantment that he encounters), and inflicts two Health Levels
	of damage on anything that comes into contact with the field.  No
	automatic soak that does not specifically target magic is allowed
	against this damage.
	¥¥ Four Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥¥ Six Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ Eight Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Ten Health Levels.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ :Paff:- any object that loses its last health level to the Field
	dissolves in a puff of smoke.  Naturally, bullets, etc. dissolved
	in this way do not inflict any damage on the mutant.

Quixotic Force (Mental) [AL or AN]
	A mutant who has this particular Power usually suffers from some sort
	of delusion derangement, but not invariably.  In any case, this Power
	might also be called Illusion Forging or Hobgoblin Forging, since it
	brings solidity to the diseased imaginings of the mutant's mind.  If
	the mutant has access to an Illusion of any kind, he can give it
	shape and substance, at least temporarily.  In fact, this often
	occurs involuntarily!  Illusions only remain forged by the Quixotic
	Force for one scene.  Use Wits + Quixotic Force (diff 6).
	
	Variation: Emotional Content- for five Freebie points, the mutant can
	take this variation, which allows him to invest Willpower into the
	illusion for extra Health, Strength, Dexterity, or Stamina (one for
	one).
	
	Variation: Whole Cloth*- making this Power double cost.  The mutant
	can create illusions with this Power with visual, auditory, and
	olfactory components.  He may or may not know that they are illusions,
	or that he is the source of them.
	
	¥ Illusions can be given one Health Level, and one dot each of Strength,
	Dexterity, and Stamina.  The mutant's own illusions (if he can make
	them) get a bonus Health Level.
	¥¥ Two Health Levels, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina
	¥¥¥ Three Health Levels, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina
	¥¥¥¥ Four Health Levels, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Health Levels, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina

Rage (Physical/Social) [PN]
	Your mutant, like the Hulk, Wolverine, or Mr. Furious, has a deep and
	abiding link between his emotions and his physical prowess.  He's
	angry, and his anger makes him more powerful.  This Power comes with a
	new Advantage (also called Rage) which can be found on the back of the
	character sheet.  This is an expendable Advantage, like Willpower, and
	it works in a similar fashion.  Once per round, a mutant may spend a 
	point of Rage.  His Rank determines the benefit that can be derived
	from it.  Sometimes, a roll is called for with this Power; when that
	happens, roll your Rage score (the Advantage) rather than your Rank in
	this Power.
	
	Note that depleted Rage is regained automatically at a rate of one
	point per day.  The player can also ask for one or more points if
	something that is particularly frustrating or outrageous happens to the
	mutant, if he has the Frenzy stunt (see below).
	
	Acquiring this Power grants one point of Rage.  Each additional point
	costs one freebie point, or (2 x current) Experience points.
	
	Note also that this is an empathic Power; one that is curiously self-
	directed.  It can certainly be neutralized with empathic attacks of a
	particular sort, but a mutant with Rage resists all empathic
	manipulations (except those intended to make him angry) with his
	current Rage score.  Friendly empathic manipulation can not recharge
	a mutant's Rage unless he has the Frenzy stunt; he can then roll his
	Rank in this Power and receives a number of Rage points equal to the
	successes he garnered.  Of course, if he gets three or more successes,
	he will enter a frenzy...

	¥ The character can spend one point of Rage.  This grants him one
	temporary die in his Strength or Stamina pool that round (whether it is
	a combat situation or not).   Note that the mutant cannot spend a point
	of Rage in the same round that he spends a point of Willpower (and vice
	versa).
	¥¥ One point of Rage grants two discretionary points for the Strength
	or Stamina dice pools that round.
	¥¥¥ Three discretionary dice are gained from one point of Rage.
	¥¥¥¥ Four discretionary dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice; these last for the remainder of the scene or combat.
	Additional points of Rage spent in subsequent rounds will not offer
	more dice.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The character can spend two points of Rage; additionally, he
	can spend a point of Rage for an extra action that round instead of
	discretionary dice.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Access of Might- the mutant may purchase the Might ability with
	Experience points.  See the listing for Mega-Strength for details.
	¥ Empathic Dampening- the mutant subtracts his Rank in this Power
	from the successes of any empathic attack against him (not Empathic
	Tracking, etc.)
	¥ Frenzy: The mutant can go into a screaming, frothing berserker
	fury.  He ignores all dice penalties but is incapable of taking any
	complex action (including the activation of most mutant powers!) Roll
	your current Rage against a difficulty of six- three successes are
	required to enter a Frenzy.  This costs one point of Rage per round.
	This is a dangerous Stunt, because whenever the mutant rolls his Rage
	hereafter, he may Frenzy.  The mutant can abort a Frenzy either by
	spending a point of Willpower or running out of Rage.  Note that each
	point of Iron Will increases the number of successes required to Frenzy
	by one, unless the mutant is deliberately trying to go into a Frenzy.
	¥ Snarl: The mutant can add his Rage rating to his Intimidation
	dice pool.
	¥¥ Moon Song- like a werewolf, your Rage feeds on the phases of the
	moon.  Your Rage is automatically refilled on the first night of the
	full moon, and your difficulty for Rage rolls are 4 on the full moon,
	5 on the gibbous moon, 6 on the half moon. 7 on the crescent moon,
	and 8 during the new moon.
	¥¥ Multiple Expense: The mutant can divide his Rage bonuses between
	Strength and Stamina pools in one round, rather than just one or the
	other.
	¥¥ Sprints- the mutant may either double his running speed for a round
	with one point of Rage, or use a point as an automatic initiative
	success for the following round.
	¥¥¥ Fury's Furnace- Requires the Stunt: Frenzy.  The mutant can roll
	his Rage to resist attempts to affect his mind (with Telepathy, etc.)-
	however, if he gets too many successes, he will go into a Frenzy. 
	Each success takes away a TP success.
	¥¥¥ Go Lunar- Requires the Stunt: Moon Song.  You can spend a Rage to
	add your Rage score to your Stealth pools during the new moon, to your
	Enigmas pools during the crescent moon, to your Leadership pools during
	the half moon, to your Expression pools during the gibbous moon, and to
	your damage pools during the full moon.
	¥¥¥ Rage Regeneration: Requires the Stunt: Frenzy.  The mutant receives
	a point of Rage in every round that he is attacked during combat.  The
	difficulty of going into a Frenzy is reduced by two.
	¥¥¥ Speed of Rage- the mutant may purchase the Power: Heightened
	Reflexes with Experience points.
	¥¥¥¥ Sound and Fury- when the mutant is in a Frenzy, his mind is buried
	and at a +1 difficulty to read or affect with Telepathy or Empathy per
	success that the mutant rolled to Frenzy in the first place.  If there
	was no such roll, assume three successes.  This is an involuntary
	Stunt.  If the mutant also has the Stunt: Stormclouds, then this Stunt
	kicks in first- it must fail (the Telepath must get in) before the
	mutant can spread his Frenzy to others via Stormclouds.
	¥¥¥¥ Stormclouds- the mutant can spread his Frenzy to Telepaths or
	Empaths that are foolish enough to enter his mind.  They must roll
	their Willpower (difficulty of the mutant's Rage) and score one
	success per success that the mutant rolled to Frenzy in the first
	place.  If there was no such roll, assume three successes.  This is
	an involuntary stunt.  If the mutant also has the Power: Projective
	Empathy, then he can inflict a Frenzy on anyone within range if he
	has the Flaw: Involuntary Projection.  This latter application does
	not require initial contact by a mindreader.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Pure Mean: The mutant can spend Rage like Willpower, for automatic
	successes in physical actions only.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Rage Beyond Death: The mutant, while in Frenzy, may continue to
	fight after being reduced to Incapacitated or below.  This costs one
	point of Rage per round, and when it runs out, he dies.  No mutant can
	regenerate Rage while in this state.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Rage Healing: For two points of Rage, the character may
	heal one Health Level of non-aggravated damage.

Redirection (Mental) [AL]
	This Power allows a mutant to channel and redirect mental assaults
	of all kinds against her - and even the use of less damaging Powers,
	so long as the mutant is a definite target.  In effect, the mutant
	gets a psychic 'dodge' (difficulty 6) against any such assault, which
	is a Wits + Redirection roll.  If the mutant gets an equal number of
	successes on this roll (or more) than the original attack, then it
	is considered redirected - the mutant picks a new target, with an
	effectiveness equal to the original roll.  This redirection does not
	require an action, but there is a limit on the number of attacks that
	the mutant can channel per round.  Indirect effects (such as a boulder
	thrown by Telekinesis, or a static discharge from Electrokinesis) are
	not affected by this Power.  The mutant can elect not to redirect a
	Power, but cannot analyze its nature while under attack.
	
	¥ One attack may be resisted per round.
	¥¥ Two attacks.
	¥¥¥ Three attacks.
	¥¥¥¥ Four attacks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five attacks.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Any number of attacks can be resisted.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can 'split' the attack (dividing successes or
	Ranks, as applicable) to affect two new victims.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Deflection- this Power is applied after other defensive Powers (such
	as Psychic Armour or Psychic Defense) have engaged.  Without this Stunt,
	Redirection is engaged first.

Reflected Existence (Social) [AL]
	Mirrors create a gate between the 'real' world and a distinctly strange
	dimension that exists alongside our own.  The mutant can enter any
	highly reflective surface as if it were a window (that is, so long as
	she can fit) and travel safely in the mirror world.  This parallel world
	contains buildings and the grosser structures, as well as plants, but
	any smaller, man-made object (such as a fork or road-sign) or animals
	(which includes humans and mutants) only exist in this mirror-world if
	they can be seen in a mirror somewhere.  Sometimes, this means that they
	only exist in the mirror world for the time it takes to blink an eye- a
	car reflected in a large puddle on the road as it passes by, for
	instance, would fade in and out of existence in the mirror world very
	quickly.
	
	For all that, any threats in the mirror world are as real as ones in the
	real world.  If the mutant falls off a cliff, for instance, she will
	sustain the same injuries as she would in the real world, and she could
	die of these injuries.  This can make operations such as crossing the
	street a bit hazardous, since a car could suddenly blink into being and
	pulverize her.
	
	Note that the mutant's interactions with the mirror world rarely have
	an effect on the real world.  Note also that the mere smashing of a 
	mirror that appears to contain the mutant will only destroy one point
	of egress for her- it certainly won't cause any damage.
	
	¥¥ The mutant can enter the mirror world and leave it at will.  She
	must do this by touch, as if passing through a door.
	¥¥¥ She can also carry any object that she can lift with her into the
	mirror world- not merely her clothes.  These objects (unlike others)
	will have a real and solid existence in the mirror world (and will not
	fade away in the absence of a mirror).  The mutant must still touch the
	mirror to open the way.  Of course, even if she can lift a grand piano,
	the mutant must find a mirror large enough to accommodate it.  Note that
	pools of water may be used as gates, but they still ripple, so process
	will necessarily be slow.  An object cannot be caught halfway between
	worlds by destroying the mirror partway through- it will be pushed into
	one or the other, depending on what proportion of it is through when
	the reflection is disrupted.  No highly reflective object can be taken
	into the mirror world.
	¥¥¥¥ She can also carry a person into the mirror world by holding his
	hand as she walks through.  The same rules apply to the person as apply
	to objects that have been brought through.  The person can leave the
	mirror world at will (as if he had this Power) but may not re-enter it
	unassisted.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can interact with the real world by interacting with
	the reflected world.  This includes attacking people who are reflected
	in a mirror.  Of course, the victim can counterattack by watching the
	position of the mutant in the mirror, but this isn't easy.  If the
	mutant's actions shove the object out of the view of a mirror, then it
	promptly vanishes from her view (but does not vanish from existence,
	of course).

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Investiture- through the expenditure of a point of Power Charge,
	the mutant can permanently 'charge' an object so that it exists in the
	mirror world regardless of position.  Living things cannot be invested
	in this way.

Reflective Feedback (Social) [AN]
	Your mutant has the odd ability to capitalize on the failures of
	opponents who try to affect her with their Powers.  If an opponent uses
	a Power that directly affects the mutant (Telepathy or Biomanipulation
	would fit this description, but not Energy Emission or Body Weaponry,
	because those Powers do not directly apply to the mutant-- they are
	merely pointed _at_ the mutant), a failure results in the effect
	bouncing back and affecting the opponent.  Thus, a telepath's mind is
	opened to the mutant, or a biomanipulator is affected by the stomach
	cramps that she meant to inflict.  No roll is required.
	
	¥¥ Any Power that is meant to directly affect the mutant will be
	reflected back at the opponent if the roll to activate that Power
	fails.  The reflected attack is treated as having five successes.  The
	opponent's normal defenses apply (so if the Biomanipulator is immune to
	Biomanipulation, nothing happens) unless the initial roll was a botch,
	rather than a failure.  On a botch, all defenses are dropped.
	
Regal Bond (Social) [AN]
	Tied to the land in a bond that is almost mystical, a mutant with the
	Regal Bond seems to be the rightful ruler of the area in question.
	His association with the territory at law may not be so clear; that
	depends on such Backgrounds as Resources and Status.  Nevertheless,
	the land acknowledges the mutant, as do the people who dwell thereon.
	While the mutant is on the land, the people treat him as though he
	is more Charismatic.  The land flourishes (whether agriculturally or
	in some other fashion) under his rule, or even just in his presence.
	No roll is normally required, but it would be a Charisma + Regal Bond
	roll that would be called for, in most cases.  The area that makes
	up the mutant's demesne may be as small as a neighbourhood or as
	large as a county or even country- that depends on the discretion of
	the Storyteller and certain Backgrounds and Merits.

	¥ The mutant has an effective Charisma of one point higher while in
	his demesne, and he cannot botch any social rolls (such as Leadership
	or Etiquette or Expression).  His Status (among people who live on
	the land in question) is effectively one Rank higher.  The effects
	of drought or depression are slightly lessened.
	¥¥ No animal will attack the mutant while he is in his demesne, and
	he has a Charisma and Status of two Ranks higher than normal under
	the proper circumstances.
	¥¥¥ Natural weather effects will tend to be favourable when the
	mutant is in his demesne.  So long as he is touching the ground there,
	he cannot be forced from his feet except by the most violent means
	(e.g., hit by a train or Colossus)  The mutant's Charisma is increased
	by three, and his Status among the people is three Ranks higher.
	¥¥¥¥ For the purposes of such Powers as Telepathy, Hypnosis, or Voice
	of Command, forcing a resident to attack or harm the mutant is
	considered to be a hateful act, and is easier to resist.  The mutant
	constantly gives off a mild soothing effect which tends to iron out
	disputes and make people reasonable.  Charisma and Status increased
	by 4.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The stones and earth will not harm the mutant while he is in
	his demesne, even under the influence of a mutant with Earth Control.
	His effective Charisma and Status are increased by 5.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ For the purposes of the coercive Powers listed above, the
	residents resist bringing harm to the mutant as if it were a self-
	destructive act.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant has a weak psychic link with those born in his
	territory since he assumed his Regal Bond.  He can sense their
	approximate location, mood, and health with a Perception + Regal Bond
	(diff 6) as long as they are in the same dimension.  If any such
	person ever sustains more damage than he has Stamina (cumulative) the
	mutant will know.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant ignores all ones on any Social rolls he makes
	while in his demesne (that is, any roll using Charisma, Manipulation,
	or Appearance).  In addition, he receives an automatic success to all
	Diplomacy, Empathy, Expression, Instruction, Intimidation, Subterfuge,
	Leadership, Performance, and Law rolls that relate to or involve his
	demesne or his subjects.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant's Regal Bond passes along to his rightful blood
	heir (or adopted heir) on his death.  The heir gets this Power for
	free, at Rank one.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant will return from the dead in the hour of his
	people's greatest need.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Blood Harvest- the mutant may revive any dying plant in his demesne
	by offering a few drops of his blood.
	¥¥ Magnetic Presence- the mutant may purchase the Power: Mega-Charisma
	with Experience, if he did not already have that Power.
	¥¥¥ The King's Men- the mutant can turn one of his people into a
	fanatical follower, loyal unto death, if he ever scores more than six
	successes on a Charisma + Leadership roll against that person.
	¥¥¥¥ Hands of a Healer- the mutant may touch any person who dwells in
	his demesne to heal them of one Health Level of damage.  This only
	works once on any particular wound.
	¥¥¥¥ Lese Majestie- the mutant gets his Rank in Regal bond as special
	"soak dice" against any attack that would make him look unlucky or
	foolish in front of his people (such as Hex Power).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Lordship- the mutant may purchase immunity to the Powers of any
	mutant born in his demesne as a Power Stunt.  This immunity applies
	only to the specific people involved, not the Powers in general.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Gates of Hell- requires the Stunt: The King's Men.  Whenever
	the mutant's life is in serious danger in the presence of a King's
	Man, or if a King's Man has good reason to believe that the mutant is
	in mortal danger, that person regenerates one point of Willpower per
	round until he knows that the mutant is out of danger or dead.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Interdiction- the mutant has total control over the borders
	of his demesne; he can seal them to keep specific people in-- or out.
	He may also apply a general interdiction.  Affected people will be
	physically prevented from entering or leaving, as if there were a
	forcefield in place.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The King is the Land- The mutant may use the Powers: Weather
	Control, Earth Control, and Environmental Awareness, with a range
	equal to the whole of his demesne.  If he does not have these Powers,
	they may be purchased with Experience.

Replication (Social) [AL]
	This Power, a variation of Matter Control and Physical Imitation, 
	allows a mutant to create exact copies of an object by touching the
	object and then summoning the necessary raw materials from the
	environment through concentration.  As long as the materials are
	present, they will shape themselves into a duplicate of the original
	object- no questions asked!  These copies are permanent.  Organic
	compounds can be duplicated in this way, though the copy will not
	be alive.  No part of a living being (including Wolverine's
	adamantium claws) can be used as a source of raw materials for this
	Power.
	
	¥ The range of the 'environment' in which the mutant can hunt for
	materials is 10 metres.  The copy will build itself at a rate of one
	kilogram of mass per round.  The mutant must be touching the original
	object the entire time (for living objects, a grapple is required). 
	The copy will appear within (or at least, partially occupy) space at
	the same range.
	¥¥ The range of the environment is 50 metres.  The copy will build
	itself at a rate of ten kilograms of mass per round.  The mutant
	must touch the object for at least half of this period.
	¥¥¥ The range of the environment is 100 metres.  The copy will
	build itself at a rate of fifty kilograms of mass per round.  The
	mutant must touch the object for at least one third of this
	period.
	¥¥¥¥ The range of the environment is one mile.  The copy will
	build itself at a rate of 100 kilograms of mass per round.  The
	mutant must touch the object for at least one full round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The range of the environment is ten miles.  The copy will
	build itself at a rate of one tonne of mass per round.  The
	mutant must touch the object (a normal Dex + Brawl hit), at
	least fleetingly.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Disassemble- the mutant may reduce any item that he has created
	with this power back to its component parts.
	¥¥ Modification- the replicated item can be slightly modified (color,
	cosmetic details etc).
	¥¥¥ Specified Source- the mutant may choose the source of the raw
	materials for the Replication.
	¥/¥¥¥ Mental Template (Mega-Intelligence/Replication Stunt)- the
	mutant can replicate stuff without being near it.  It takes a one
	time roll to remember it for later replication (The difficulty
	varies with the complexity of the object- a baseball bat would be
	a six, while something like a computer or a dead insect would be a
	ten). The mutant can remember as many templates as he/she has
	Ranks of Mega-Intelligence.  The mutant can try to remember more
	than this amount but for every extra template the difficulty to
	store or remember any of them will increase by one, and on a botch
	all other remembered templates will be forgotten.
	¥¥¥¥ Remote Access- so long as the mutant can directly perceive 
	the original, the Power can be triggered.  This is a Perception +
	Replication (difficulty base 8, based on everyday familiarity with
	the object-- for example, an object that the mutant has touched
	many times and sees every day).

Resistance to Fate (Social) [PN]
	A mutant with this Power is, quite simply, immune to the forces of
	fate.  His actions cannot be predicted by use of augury or the
	Power: Precognition, nor can his actions be revealed through the
	use of Powers such as Danger Sense, Possibility Forging,
	Yesterscape, X-Factoring, or other such predictive Powers.  Any
	reading of the future that involves the character (even in a
	tangential way) will be difficult to analyze; murky at best.  If
	the character is central, no reading is possible.  This Power
	also gives a +2 resistance (either in increased difficulty to
	his foes, or increased dice in his resistance pool) vs. any
	Power that would make prediction of his actions more sure, such
	as Voice of Command; he cannot be judged by Powers such as Karma
	Channeling.  No roll is necessary.

	¥¥ The mutant will not be constrained by the forces of fate.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Feather-Plucking Walrus- this stunt confers immunity to Combat 
	Sense, Combat Telepathy, and Photographic Reflexes.
	¥¥ Tomorrow Never Knows- the mutant regains a point of Willpower at
	the start of each day.

Retributive Strike (Physical/Social) [AL]
	This Power comes in two variations, but in essence it is the ability 
	to return punishment received to its sender. Although it does not
	function against overwhelming onslaughts of pure punishment, this 
	Power can ensure that a mutant's attackers regret their decision to 
	throw down.  The Energy variant is a Social Power, while the Force 
	variant is a Physical Power.  No roll is required in most cases
	for either variant.

	* Energy- this variant functions against energy attacks of most sorts, 
	excluding kinetic force attacks. Thus, Pyro could attack the mutant 
	with flame, but would find himself burning instead.  Mr. Sinister 
	could attack the character with Generic Unidentifiable Energy(tm) and 
	have it revisited upon him. On the other hand, Jean Grey could attack 
	the mutant with Telekinesis with no fear of retribution.

	Variation: Mirror Energy- instead of returning the same sort of energy 
	back to its source, this variation returns a different sort (the 
	opposite, if possible)- thus Iceman would find himself blasted by heat, 
	and Dagger would be struck by Balefire. If there is no obvious 
	opposite, then use Energy Force or Heat. This variation costs two 
	freebie or experience points per Rank.

	* Force- this variant functions against physical attacks, including 
	blunt force trauma, cutting attacks, and kinetic energy attacks such 
	as Telekinesis, Energy Emission: Kinetic Force, and Sound Generation. 
	Instead of the mutant suffering the damage from the attack, the source 
	of the assault will suffer.

	¥ The mutant can return up to 2 Health Levels of damage back to its 
	source. The mutant need not soak this damage. If more than this amount 
	is inflicted, then the mutant must soak ALL of the damage, and none of 
	it is reflected.
	¥¥ The mutant can return up to 3 Health Levels of damage.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can return up to 4 Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can return up to 5 Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can return up to 6 Health Levels.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can return up to 8 Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Ten Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Twelve Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Fourteen Health Levels.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty Health Levels.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Instrument of Pain- if the attacker is using a weapon to hurt the 
	mutant, he may elect either to return the attack on the attacker (the 
	default) or the weapon itself.
	¥¥¥ Pick Target- The damage from a Retributive Strike need not be 
	returned to sender, but rather can be visited on another enemy.  A 
	Willpower check (difficulty of the soak diff) must be passed to use 
	this Stunt.
	¥¥¥ Vengeance- The mutant can initiate a Retributive Strike even if 
	the attack exceeds the level of damage allowed by his Rank. The mutant
	must soak the full amount of the damage, but the source of the attack 
	must soak the maximum reflected amount allowed by the mutant's Rank 
	in this Power.
	¥¥¥¥ Cover Fire- by spending a point of Power Charge, a mutant with
	this Stunt can actually attract an energy attack meant for someone else
	to himself, and initiate a Retributive Strike. Requires the Energy
	variant.
	¥¥¥¥ Kamikaze Burst- requires the Stunts: Vengeance and Pick Target. 
	The mutant can Strike everyone within 20 feet with the energy from an
	attack (including a physical attack) by electing to take the damage 
	from the attack and then share it with everyone. If he wants to exclude 
	a person within the radius from taking damage, he must spend a Willpower 
	point.

Rigging (Mental) [AL]
	With this Power, a mutant becomes attuned, intuitively, with a
	mechanical object- in this case, a vehicle.  Once he has attuned
	himself to the vehicle, it becomes as familiar to him as his own body,
	and will respond to his commands almost as readily.  He instinctively
	knows its capabilities and limitations.  Even if he has never sat in
	such a vehicle before, he will pilot it like a master after a few
	moments of study.  Razorback had this Power.  (I know, I know...)  The
	usual system is Perception + Rigging (difficulty 6).
	
	¥ The mutant can improve his Drive and Piloting skills to the sixth
	Rank with Experience.  He can attune to a typical vehicle with one
	round of concentration.  He must have a sufficient score in Pilot or
	Drive to do this (no harriers with Pilot 1).  While he is attuned
	(until he forms a link with another vehicle), all difficulties to
	pilot that vehicle are reduced by one, and he has one automatic 'six'
	on all related rolls.
	¥¥ Drive and Pilot can be increased to seven.  He has two automatic
	'sixes' on all rolls.  The mutant instinctively recognizes any damage
	or tampering that the vehicle has suffered when he attunes to it; no
	roll is required.
	¥¥¥ Drive and Pilot can be increased to eight.  All Repair rolls that
	relate to the vehicle are reduced in difficulty by 2, and can be
	finished in half the time.  The mutant receives two automatic 'sevens'
	on all related rolls.
	¥¥¥¥ Drive and Pilot can be increased to nine, and all difficulties to
	pilot the craft are reduced by two.  The mutant understands the design
	of the vehicle well enough to make enhancements beyond that of the
	average mechanic; with a day's work per ten percent improvement, he
	can enhance the vehicle's top speed, stall speed, power, acceleration,
	or fuel consumption (to a maximum of forty percent; only two
	modifications per vehicle).  The materials required to do this must be
	paid for normally.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Drive and Pilot can be increased to ten, and the mutant receives
	three automatic 'sevens' on all such rolls when using an attuned
	vehicle.  The mutant may attempt to attune to a vehicle of a design
	advanced beyond his experience (alien craft, for instance)... this is
	a Perception + Rigging, difficulty 8 or higher.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Fake it- the mutant can substitute his Rank in this Power for
	Pilot or Drive, if his Rank in Rigging is higher.
	¥ Telelocation- the mutant can feel the presence of the vehicle that
	he is currently attuned to; he always knows exactly how far away it
	is, and in what direction it lies.  This does not cross dimensional
	lines, of course.
	¥¥ No Hands!- the mutant does not actually have to watch the road or
	have more than his foot (for instance) on the wheel to keep the vehicle
	going.  Don't try this in combat.
	¥¥ Old Betsy- the mutant can spend a point of Permanent Willpower to
	create another attunement 'slot'-- the mutant will always be attuned
	to a particular vehicle, and in addition may attune to another vehicle
	as above.  Any number of additional 'slots' may be created in this
	way.
	¥¥¥ Borrow Senses- if the vehicle has 'sense organs' like radar,
	sonar, etc. then the mutant may perceive with them directly on a
	Perception + Rigging roll.
	¥¥¥ Double Up- the mutant gets one extra driving action per turn-
	he may devote his regular action to anything else he wants.
	¥¥¥¥ Mental Blueprint- requires the Stunt: Old Betsy.  A vehicle which
	is in one of the mutant's "Old Betsy" slots may be rebuilt or duplicated
	as if the mutant had the Power: Hyper-Invention.	
	¥¥¥¥ Zen and the Art of Driving- the mutant requires one less success
	to complete a driving action successfully.  If this reduces the
	requirement to zero, he may do it automatically if he chooses (though
	his performance won't look too stylish).
	¥¥¥¥¥ True Rigging- the mutant may purchase the Power: Technological
	Telepathy with Experience, even if he didn't start the game with that
	Power.

Riposte (Physical) [AL]
	A character with this Power can always attempt to make reply to
	any physical attack (Brawling, Melee, or Firearms), and in so doing,
	avoid the damage associated with it.  Any time the character is
	attacked and successfully struck, she may opt to attempt to duplicate
	the feat (rolling Dex + Brawl, Dex + Firearms, or what have you, at the
	appropriate difficulty).  If she scores an appropriate number of
	successes, then she takes no damage and the opponent must soak the 
	damage instead.  Of course, the mutant must have the appropriate tools 
	at hand to attempt to riposte- she cannot riposte a firearms attack 
	without access to a firearm.

	¥ The mutant requires the same number of successes or greater than
	her opponent scored to riposte.  A maximum of one attack can be
	subject to riposte per round.
	¥¥ Four successes or an equal number of successes are required,
	whichever is fewer, against the first attack.  Against a second
	attack (the maximum), treat as rank one.
	¥¥¥ Three successes or less are required against the first attack
	in a round, four or less against the second, and the final eligible
	attack is treated as rank one.
	¥¥¥¥ Two successes or less are required against the first attack in
	a round, three or less against the second, four or less against the
	third, and the fouth (final) eligible attack is treated as rank one.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Only one success is required against the first attack in a 
	round, with each subsequent attack treated at one rank lower than
	the previous one.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Yadomejutsu- the mutant is eligible to learn the ancient art of
	arrow and knife deflection (a Talent)- Yado requires the mutant to
	match his opponent's successes to hit, except at diff 7.  If he
	succeeds, he takes no damage.  He may attempt to catch these missiles;
	this is a diff 8 trick.
	¥¥¥ Share the Pain- the mutant may transfer the target attack of his
	riposte to someone other than the attacker by making a successful
	riposte check as if he was two Ranks lower.
	¥¥¥ Slap and Tickle- the mutant, when riposting against a melee or
	brawl attack, may reduce the damage by one step (from lethal to
	bashing, or aggravated to lethal) by spending three successes.
	¥¥¥/¥ Twofoot (Riposte/Psychic Link combination Stunt)- If the mutant
	is in range to deflect/riposte an attack on something or someone that
	he has a psychic link to, he may do so as if he was two Ranks lower
	in this Power.

Riskbreaking (Physical/Social) [AH]
	A potent ability closely related to Riposte, Riskbreaking is the
	ability to string a sequence of attacks, one after the other, using a
	Melee weapon or Martial Arts.  Time seems to slow down for the mutant
	as he makes attack after devastating attack on his opponent, all in the
	space of a few seconds.  As he attacks, however, he makes himself more
	vulnerable to counter attack. 
	
	In essence, the mutant makes a Melee or Martial Arts attack as normal.
	If he decides to press another assault that round, he must roll the
	same system at an increased difficulty.  The 'window' of successes he
	must match depends on his Rank.  In any case, the mutant may string
	together as many attacks as he is able, though the difficulty of each
	successive attack is +1 (max of 10).  The mutant may make an indefinite
	number of attacks so long as none of them miss or are dodged/parried,
	etc.  Even if an attack is soaked, it is considered successful.
	
	¥ The mutant may press his attack again (on the same opponent) after
	scoring a successful hit.  This second attack is at +1 difficulty
	(seven, if the original difficulty was six).  In order to succeed,
	the attack must have the same number of successes (neither more nor
	less) than the previous roll.  After the attack is done, the mutant's
	difficulty modifier (one if he attempted only one extra attack, four
	if he successfully prosecuted three extra attacks and attempted a
	fourth) is subtracted from all opponents' difficulty to hit him _that
	round_.
	¥¥ If the mutant gets one less or one extra success than on the
	previous roll (so long as that doesn't result in a miss), the extra
	attack succeeds and the mutant may press again.
	¥¥¥ Two successes, more or less, are acceptable.
	¥¥¥¥ Three successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Four successes.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Limit Break (Level one)- the mutant may spend a point of Power
	Charge or Gnosis to release a special attack that is related to the
	particular weapon that he is using.  This attack may have a special
	elemental affinity (Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Dark) or
	(alternately) it may enjoy a decreased difficulty for damage tests.
	Every kind of weapon (be it swords, maces, axes, guns, bare hands,
	etc.) has a different limit break, and requires a different Stunt to
	develop. A level one Limit Break can only be executed as the second hit
	in a chain (or later).  One extra Health Level of damage may be
	assessed for an affinity, if appropriate.
	¥¥ Limit Meter- requires the Stunt: Limit Break.  The mutant 'builds
	up' toward a Limit Break during a fight by being struck.  Every Health
	Level of physical damage inflicted on him, whether it is soaked or not
	(not counting damage which is automatically soaked by Powers such as
	Body Armour or Invulnerability) fills up the Limit Meter, which is
	released (allowing the mutant to execute a Limit Break outside of a
	chain) when the damage received totals five Health Levels per Level of
	the Limit Break he wants to execute.  The Limit Meter resets after a
	Limit Break of any level is executed, or at the end of the fight.
	¥¥¥ Limit Break (Level two)- requires the level one version of the
	Limit Break for the particular weapon in use.  A point of Power
	Charge or Gnosis may be spent to release a slightly more powerful
	attack.  It may have an energy affinity (as per the Energy List,
	above), or have two elemental affinities, or a decreased difficulty
	to hit and for damage tests, or one elemental affinity and a 
	decreased difficulty, etc.  In order to use a level two Limit Break,
	the mutant must initiate it in the second hit in a chain or later.
	Up to three additional Health Levels of damage may be assessed
	for an affinity.
	¥¥¥ Second Limit- the mutant may develop another level one Limit
	Break for a particular weapon type.
	¥¥¥ Store Meter- requires the Stunt: Limit Meter.  The mutant's Limit
	Meter does not reset at the end of a fight (though it does empty when a
	Limit Break is used).
	¥¥¥¥ Limit Break (Level three)- requires the level two version of
	the Limit Break for the particular weapon in use.  A point of Power
	Charge or Gnosis may be spent to release a slightly more powerful
	attack.  This may involve a special affinity (making the attack
	vampiric or eldritch) or greater advantages in the vein of the level
	two Limit Breaks (ST's approval required).  In order to use a level
	three Limit Break, the mutant must initiate it in the third hit or
	later in a chain.  Up to five additional Health Levels of damage may
	be assessed for an affinity.
	¥¥¥¥ Riskbreak- the mutant may either cancel his defensive penalty or
	assess his increased difficulty on an opponent's next action by
	'counting coup' (successfully hitting but deliberately inflicting no
	damage) on the last strike in a chain.  He must exactly match his
	previous successes to do so.
	¥¥¥¥ Second Limit- another level two Limit Break for a particular
	weapon type may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥ Third Limit- a third level one Limit Break for a particular
	weapon type may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Limit Break (Level four)*- Also called the Ultimate Technique
	for a weapon (only one per weapon type, as above).  Requires the
	level three Limit Break for the particular weapon in use.  Two 
	points of Power Charge or Gnosis are required to initiate the attack,
	which will always end a chain, and will have special effects 
	(carrying the effects of a Rank five or lower Power that the mutant
	has, or up to Rank three in a Power he does not have).  In addition
	to decreased damage and accuracy requirements, an increased reroll
	range (nine to ten rather than ten) is also possible.  An Ultimate
	Technique must be initiated in the fourth hit or later in a chain.
	Up to seven additional Health Levels of damage (or double, whichever
	is greater) may be assessed for any affinities this stunt has.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Second limit- another level three Limit Break for a particular
	weapon type may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Third limit- a third level two Limit Break for a particular
	weapon type may be learned.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Fourth limit- a fourth level one Limit Break for a particular
	weapon type may be learned.

Secretions (Physical) [PN]
	This is not necessarily a disgusting power, though it usually does
	invoke a certain amount of disgust.  Any sort of poison or glue or
	acid, any sort of gas, can be created by the mutant's body and then
	secreted for use.  Webcasting, when it is natural and not scientific,
	is a form of secretion.  Archangel secreted a paralytic poison onto
	his wing-blades, when he still had his metallic wings.  Most breath
	weapons are a gas-form of the Secretion power.  No roll is required
	for most of the variations, but if one is needed, it will probably
	be a Stamina + Secretions roll.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Acid- nearly always a liquid, but any corrosive gas or mist would
	also fit the bill.  The mutant is immune to her own acid.  Requires
	a Stamina + Secretions roll (diff 6).  Default configuration: Stream
	* Bioluminescence- the mutant secretes a luminescent liquid or gas (up
	to the power of one 100-watt light bulb per 10 mL of the substance) that
	sheds light for one hour per Rank.  The mutant secretes up to 10 mL per
	round, to a limit of the mutant's Rank x 20 in mL per scene.  The
	player and ST may determine between them how long the substance sheds
	light, but one scene or more is not unreasonable.  Default configuation:
	Stream
	* Electricity- like electric eels, your body excretes an electrical
	field.  Requires a Stamina + Secretions roll (diff 6). [AL]  Default
	configuration: Cloud
	* Freezing Gel- a viscous gum that inflicts cold damage on all that
	come into contact with it (think Hollywood's portrayal of liquid
	nitrogen).  Default configuration: Stream
	* Glue- a sticky, liquid substance which may dry hard, or may remain
	rubbery and gummy (like tar).  Default configuration: Stream
	* Heat- the mutant can get very hot to the touch.  This adds damage
	dice in grappling situations.  Pick your clothing carefully.
	Requires a Stamina + Secretions roll (diff 6). [AL]  Default
	configuration: Ooze
	* Hypnotic- a fluid or gas is released that opens up the mind to
	suggestions, reducing a victim's ability to resist Telepathy, Voice of
	Command, Persuasion, and like abilities.  Requires a Manipulation +
	Secretions roll (diff 8), adding one per success to the difficulty of
	Willpower checks to resist such Powers. [PL]  Default configuration:
	Stream
	* Liquid Skin- a glutinous, whey-coloured substance that is empath-
	sensitive.  Once released, it changes its colour and consistency
	until the mutant is pleased-- this makes it useful for making very
	impressive disguises (almost to shapeshifting quality).  It can be
	used on the mutant, or on other persons.  It can also be used to make
	imitations of objects (though it will rarely serve the functions of
	those objects, having only their appearance).  Each Rank in this
	variation yields enough liquid skin to disguise one large human, once
	per day.  Default configuration: Ooze
	* Pheromone- these can incite fear, arousal, hunger, anger, euphoria,
	or sorrow (pick one).  Some other reactions are possible.  Usually a
	gas, but not always.  The mutant is typically immune to her own
	pheromone.  Requires a Manipulation + Secretions roll (diff 8).  Default
	configuration: Stream
	* Poison- this can be damaging, soporific, noxious, or paralytic.
	The damaging forms can be tissue-destructive, asphyxiant, or can
	provoke some severe allergic reaction.  It can come in liquid or
	gaseous forms.  The mutant is immune to her own poison.    Default
	configuration: Ooze
	* Power Damp- a thick miasma, surrounding the mutant when she activates
	it, that interferes with the mitochondrial activity.  It drains a point
	of Power Charge per round.  The victim must succeed on a Willpower
	check to resist (one success per Rank required).  Default configuration:
	Cloud
	* Power Detection- a solid, liquid, or gaseous substance that glows in
	the presence of Power Charge (not the mutant's own).  The colour and 
	luminosity of the discharge varies with the concentration of Power
	Charge in the area.  For one freebie point, the player may choose some
	other sensory clue (tactile, olfactory, etc.) instead of a visual one.
	Default configuration: Ooze
	* Slime- a viscous, slippery goo from the pores.  This stuff is very
	slippery, allowing the mutant extra dice to escape from grapples and
	tight situations.  It can be lain on the ground, on handholds, etc. as
	a trap; the number of successes required to avoid slipping vary by
	Rank.  Default configuration: Ooze
	* Webbing- this substance will vary in tensile strength and stickiness
	with the Rank of the Power, but is basically like Spider-man's stuff.
	Default configuration: Stream
	
	Configurations:
	* Cloud- for five extra points per Rank (Experience or Freebie points),
	the mutant releases her secretion in the form of a cloud or fog.  This
	delivery method may not be appropriate for all variations.  The range
	is 5 feet per Rank.  Note that variations that have 'Cloud' as the
	default configuration do not have to pay extra Freebie points for it.
	* Ooze- part or all of the mutant's body is coated in the secretion.
	The range is touch.
	* Stream- a narrow-gauge fluid stream (such as that which Spider-man
	uses for his webbing) is exuded from a discrete part of the mutant's
	body, such as the eyes, mouth, or wrist.  Use Dex + Directed Blast to
	hit.  Range is usually no more than 5 feet per Rank.	
	
	¥ Inflicts one health level of damage (usually aggravated), or 3
	successes on a Strength check are required to break free of it
	(webbing or glue)
	¥¥ Inflicts two health levels of damage, or 4 successes are required
	to break free.
	¥¥¥ Inflicts three health levels of damage, or 5 successes are
	required to break free.
	¥¥¥¥ Inflicts four health levels of damage, or 6 successes are
	required to break free.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Inflicts five health levels of damage, or 7 successes are
	required to break free.
	
	The chemical composition of the secretion may provide a weak point
	for others to exploit (Iceman can freeze Spidey's webbing until it
	is brittle, for instance).  Gas attacks can be made once every
	three rounds.  Projectile attacks (like glue or webbing) are subject
	to a limit of 'charges'- one charge is created per hour (enough of
	the substance to make one attack), and the mutant can store a number
	of charges equal to her Stamina + Secretion score.
	
	Acid rolls its damage pool every round until diluted or neutralized.
	Blood will do dilution duty handily in most cases (ST says when you
	start to bleed- a strong acid can start it at the end of the first
	round).
	
	Damaging poison rolls its damage pool every round, but with one less
	die each round, until it loses its potency or kills the subject.  If
	the poison is washed off or purged somehow, it stops damaging the
	subject. 
	
	Noxious poisons reduce their victims' Dexterity and Stamina pools
	by one die per Rank, for one round per Rank (each round losing a die
	of potency).  Any action which has an empty dice pool (too many dice
	lost) cannot be attempted.
	
	Paralytics have a Strength score instead of a damage pool- equal to
	the Strength required for the glue or webbing resistance.  This score
	is subtracted from the target's Strength.  If the target's Strength
	is zero or less, he is paralyzed.  The poison loses one point of
	Strength per round until it is gone.
	
	Soporifics require a Stamina check (diff 6) with a success requirement
	equal to the Rank of the poison (thus, a Rank 5 soporific requires
	five successes to resist).  Iron Will or Pure Mean can be applied as
	extra dice (not automatic successes) for this check.  The victim may
	be asleep for several rounds, depending on the number of successes
	that he missed when making his resistance roll:
	
	One short:  one round
	Two short:  four rounds
	Three short: nine rounds
	Four short: sixteen rounds
	Five short: twenty-five rounds
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Acid):
	¥ Basic- rather than producing a powerful acid, the mutant instead
	produces a base (such as lye).
	¥¥ Molecular- rather than producing an ionic acid, the mutant instead
	produces a molecular acid.
	¥¥¥¥ Concentrated- without the application of a base, the acid will,
	at best, be reduced in strength by one or two Ranks when diluted.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Freezing Gel):
	¥ Resistance- the mutant may purchase the Power: Energy Resistance
	(Cold) with Experience.
	¥¥ Superconductor- electricity passing through the gel or a substance
	in contact with the gel encounters greatly reduced resistance; add the
	mutant's Rank in Secretions as automatic successes for purposes of
	electrical damage.
	¥¥¥ Insulation- the gel's incredible specific heat capacity offers one
	extra soak die per Rank vs. heat, cold, or fire attacks to anything
	coated with it.  This does not apply to Pyrokinetic or Cryokinetic
	attacks.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Hypnotic):
	¥¥ Breakdown- by spending a point of Willpower or Power Charge, the
	mutant may release a concentrated version of his secretion that removes
	one point of temporary Willpower per success (Man + Secretions, diff
	8).
	¥¥¥ Soothe the Savage Breast- in addition to decreasing the victim's
	resistance to empathic and telepathic assaults, each success on the
	Man + Secretions roll may be applied to increase Rage difficulties by
	one (choose the effect of each success on the initial roll).
	¥¥¥¥ Walls of Jericho- requires the Stunt: Breakdown.  The mutant's
	secretion is so potent that it can be used to break down otherwise
	unassailable defenses such as Psychic Invulnerability.  If the victim's
	temporary Willpower falls below the current Rank of such defensive
	Powers, those Powers are either reduced in effectiveness or cease to
	function altogether.  The maximum effective Rank of such defenses is
	equal to the victim's temporary Willpower.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Noxious):
	¥¥ Stench- the secretion creates a horrible stench as part of the
	noxious effect (either prior to or because of contact with the victim)
	which increases the difficulty of all scent-related Perception rolls 
	to 10.
	¥¥¥ Debilitating- even trivial activities (such as walking, talking)
	that typically do not require an action now require the mutant to use
	an action while the poison is in effect.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Slime):
	¥ Carrier- if the mutant has another substance that she can secrete, 
	it can be carried in her slime.
	¥ Waterproofing- objects can be coated in the slime to offer protection
	against rain for a number of days equal to its Rank.  Against full
	immersion, it is effective only for one round/Rank.
	¥¥ Dries hard- if the slime is not in continual contact with the
	mutant's skin, it dries very quickly.  This is not enough to restrain,
	but the slime is very hard, and must be chipped off.
	¥¥ Slime throwing- the mutant may 'squirt' the slime as he might shoot
	webbing.  This is a Dex + Missiles roll, typically diff. 7.  The range
	is four feet per Rank.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Soporific):
	¥¥ Fuzzy Focus- even if the victim succeeds and remains awake, he is
	at -1 to all actions due to grogginess for one round per Rank.
	¥¥¥ Enter Sandman- the time lapse for sleep is measured in hours, not
	rounds.
	
	Sample Power Stunts (Webbing):
	¥ Carrier- if the mutant has another substance that she can secrete, 
	it can be carried in her webbing.
	¥ Dissolving- the webbing dissolves after a period of hours or minutes
	agreed upon by player and ST.
	¥¥ Cohesive- the webbing can bear weight equal to the equivalent Rank
	of Adhesion.
	¥¥ Flammable- the webbing is highly flammable, inflicting an additional
	Health Level of damage per Rank to anything stuck to it, if it is lit
	on fire.
	¥¥¥¥ Razor webbing- in addition to its regular properties, the webbing
	inflicts damage equal to its Rank when it is first applied, and in any
	round in which the victim attempts to escape.

Seeding* (Social) [AH]
	The ST should think twice before allowing a player to take this Power
	for his character.  Like Synergy of Stormwatch, a mutant with this
	ability can bring out dormant metahuman abilities in others, or make
	them dormant again.  The range of this Power is touch, and it requires
	a substantial investment of energy on the part of the mutant.  Note
	that this ability doesn't just work with mutants; it'll work on
	Inhumans, Deviants, Eternals, and the whole gamut of aliens.  It will
	even work on humans if the mutant's Rank in this Power is high enough.
	Use of this Power requires the expenditure of a lot of Willpower,
	and possibly Power Charge.  The initial system (after physical contact
	has been made) is Charisma + Seeding (difficulty 6).  Normally, Seeding
	only affects active Powers, not passive ones.
	
	If a creature's Powers have been shut off by this Power, these Powers
	are treated as if the creature had the Flaw: Dormant Power.
	
	¥ Only mutants may be affected; Powers of up to Rank ¥ may be activated
	with the Expenditure of a point of Willpower.
	¥¥ Only mutants may be affected; Powers of up to Rank ¥¥ may be activated
	or deactivated with two points of Willpower.
	¥¥¥ Mutants and other beings born with Powers (such as Inhumans, aliens,
	etc.) may be affected; Mutant Powers up to Rank ¥¥¥ may be activated or
	deactivated.  Treat other species as if the Power was two Ranks lower.
	¥¥¥¥ Altered humans such as Spider-Man and Captain America may be
	affected; Mutant Powers up to Rank ¥¥¥¥ may be activated or deactivated;
	otherwise treat as if two Ranks lower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Non-powered beings such as mutants that have not yet manifested
	(not old enough, for instance) may be affected; this requires a point
	of Power Charge per point that the target has in Power Potential, in
	addition to a Rank's worth of Willpower.  Mutant Powers up to Rank ¥¥¥¥¥
	may be affected (this is the maximum Rank that can be affected).

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Non-powered beings such as flatscan humans may be affected (this
	happened to Rick Jones); this requires a point of Power Charge per point
	of Power Potential and a Rank's worth of Willpower.  Non-mutant Powers
	up to Rank ¥¥¥¥ may be affected.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Non-mutant Powers up to Rank ¥¥¥¥¥ may be affected.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Detect Powers- the mutant can tell if a target creature has powers,
	or the potential to have powers with a Perception + Seeding (diff 6).
	¥¥ Gauge Power- the mutant can determine the Power Potential, Actual
	Power Level, and Power Charge of a target with a Perception + Seeding
	(diff 6).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Level Boost- the mutant can raise a target's Actual Power Level
	by a number of points equal to the number of Permanent Power Charge
	that she is willing to spend.  Naturally, it cannot exceed the target's
	Power Potential.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Passive- the mutant may affect a target's passive Powers as
	well as his active Powers with this Stunt.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Stunting- the mutant may crush a victim's Actual Power Level
	with the Expenditure of one point of Willpower and one point of
	Power Charge per point of Actual Power Level to be affected.  This
	loss may only be reversed through the use of the Level Boost stunt or
	Experience points.

Seismic Assault (Social) [AL]
	Like Avalanche of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, a mutant with
	Seismic Assault is capable of attacking people through a combination
	of disintegration and liquification.  Most solid (or near-solid)
	substances can be manipulated in this way, creating waves and troughs
	in an otherwise placid surface.  Note that this Power, unlike
	Vibration Control, does not actually create vibrations!  Rather, it
	imitates an earthquake's grosser effects (like the tears and ripples).
	Unlike Earth Control, this Power routinely affects plastic, glass,
	and stranger materials.  Exceptionally hard substances (like
	adamantium) and dense crystal lattices (like diamond) are difficult or
	impossible to affect.  As always, it does not directly affect living
	substances.  The system for this Power is Manipulation + Seismic
	Assault (diff 6).
	
	Special Flaw: Organic Feedback (2 pts)- like Avalanche, your mutant has
	a serious problem when he tries to affect living matter.  The normal
	damage for your Power rebounds on you in bashing damage whenever you
	inadvertently target the wrong stuff.
	
	¥ The mutant can cause up to two Health Levels of incidental damage
	per round, and penetrate up to one foot of thickness of material per
	round, affecting as much as a ton of matter.
	¥¥ The mutant can cause up to three Health Levels of damage per round,
	penetrate up to two feet of thickness, affect as much as four tons.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can cause up to four Health Levels of damage, penetrate
	up to four feet of thickness, affect as much as eight tons.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can cause up to five Health Levels of damage,
	penetrate up to eight feet of thickness, affect as much as sixteen
	tons.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can cause up to six Health Levels of damage,
	penetrate up to sixteen feet of thickness, affecting as much as
	thirty-two tons.

Serial Immortality (Mental) [AH]
	Doctor Doom, Jean Grey, and the White Queen have all demonstrated that
	they are capable of serial immortality- they can take over a new body
	when their bodies run out of luck.  Not all forms of Serial Immortality
	require possession, however; there are a number of variations.
	
	Mental Powers immediately cross over with the mutant into the new body,
	in any case.  Physical and Social Powers are lost.  If the mutant has
	Psychic Immortality or Reanimation, any passive Physical Powers that
	the new body has are automatically put at the mutant's disposal; any
	Social or active Physical Powers that the body has may be used at the
	cost of a point of Willpower.  This restriction on each Power lasts
	until the mutant improves that Power's rank with Experience.
	
	The mutant keeps her Talents, Skills, and Knowledges, as well as her
	Wits, Perception, Intelligence, Manipulation, Charisma, and Willpower.
	The remaining Attributes (including Power Potential, Actual Power
	Level, etc.) are that of the new body.  Some Merits or Flaws
	(Psychological, etc.) and Backgrounds may transfer, while others will
	be left behind.  Some may attach as a result of the transfer.
	
	Variation: Alter Ego- the target of the mutant's attentions when she
	is slain immediately gains the Power: Alter Ego, with the mutant's
	psyche as the other personality.  This is less intrusive than the
	Psychic Immortality variation (in that it is impossible to destroy
	the body's original mind), but the victim only receives a check to
	resist the original intrusion if he has psychic defenses of some kind.
	
	Variation: Psychic Immortality- The mutant rolls her Willpower (diff of
	the victim's Willpower) in a contested roll against the potential
	victim (diff of the mutant's Willpower).  Assuming the mutant wins, she
	can either force out the old psyche (presumably into her own, doomed
	body) or bury it deeply, where it can attempt to wrest control over the
	body when the mutant suffers a particularly vulnerable moment.  Fully
	forcing out a psyche requires that the mutant's Willpower roll exceeded
	the victim's by at least three successes.  This is not an extended roll
	unless the first round resulted in deadlock.
	
	Variation: Reanimation- the mutant, when she flees her body, energizes
	and revivifies a recently dead and unmutilated corpse.  The body, as
	noted, must be reasonably intact, but life functions and some body
	repair take place upon the entry of the psyche.  Note that the mutant
	can not animate her own body in this way.  She can not control which
	body she enters, but the mutant's psyche is drawn to one type, which is
	chosen at character creation: either the most proximal, most recently
	deceased, least damaged, or most similar (in terms of sex, attributes,
	age) bodies will be chosen.  When the reanimation takes place, the
	mutant has only one point in each Attribute; each increases by one
	point per day to its regular value during the adjustment period.
	
	Variation: Spontaneous Creation- when the mutant is slain, his psyche
	begins the slow process of creating the flesh of a new body.  Nearby
	matter and energy is diverted toward this end, albeit slowly (ten
	weeks minus one week per point of Power Charge that the mutant had 
	when he died).  When the process is complete, the mutant is 'reborn',
	literally, as a child (with one point in each Attribute), all but
	helpless.  He will age at the rate of one year per week until his
	former age is restored.  The mutant's Actual Power Level is also
	reduced to three (even if some Powers have higher Ranks), which must
	be built up again with Experience points.  All Powers are retained
	(including Physical and Social Powers).  However, their Ranks are
	reduced to three, if possible, or made dormant (in the case of
	fixed-rank Powers such as Invisibility).
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant, at the time of death, spends a point of Power Charge
	(to ensure resurrection) or makes a Willpower check, diff 8, if no
	Power Charge is available.  Assuming success, she shall shortly find
	herself in a new body.

Serial Resurrection* (Physical) [PN]
	The Resurrection Man finds himself awakening in a new body, with new
	powers, each time that he is slain.  A mutant with this Power has the
	same distinction.  Whenever the mutant is killed (let it not be a
	regular occurrence!), the player makes a new mutant, who has all of the
	memories of the old mutant, and one of his Powers: this one.  Apart
	from that, the new character's name, appearance, and Powers may well
	be radically different.  All of the Talents, Skills, and Knowledges
	are retained in the new body, as is Willpower.  The mutant's Rank in 
	this Power never changes from body to body, but in other respects, the 
	new body may well have weaker Ranks in Powers as well as Attributes.  
	The mutant must succeed in a Willpower check (diff 6) to successfully
	reanimate-- this roll is not made against his permanent Willpower, but
	his current Willpower.
	
	¥ The mutant retains his Rank in Serial Resurrection, Willpower, and
	Talents, Skills, and Knowledges.  Otherwise, the mutant has five Ranks
	to distribute between his new Powers, and the standard 7/5/3 to arrange
	Attributes, 5 Background points.  His Actual Power Level is always at
	least equal to the mutant's Rank in this Power, or 3, whichever is
	greater.  Otherwise, the mutant has 6 Freebie points to spend.
	¥¥ The mutant retains Rank as above, and can has six Ranks to spend on
	his other Powers, and 8/6/3 to arrange Attributes.  He also has 6
	Background points, and 8 Freebies.
	¥¥¥ As above, but the mutant has seven Ranks to spend on Powers, 9/6/4
	to arrange Attributes, 7 Background points, and 10 Freebie points.  His
	Power Potential is at least 5.
	¥¥¥¥ As above, but the mutant has eight Ranks to spend on Powers, 9/6/5
	to arrange Attributes, 8 Background points, and 12 Freebie points.
	¥¥¥¥¥ As above, but the mutant has nine Ranks to spend on Powers, 9/7/5
	to spend on Attributes, 9 Background points, and 15 Freebie points.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ As above, but the mutant retains the number of Ranks he had in
	his Powers before death, or eleven Ranks, whichever is more.  He gets
	10/8/6 to spend on Attributes, 11 Background points, and 18 Freebie
	points.

Shadow Fighting (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	This Power comes in several nasty variations: brawling, firearms, melee, 
	missiles, and tools. Joe the Dead, of Wildstorm fame, is known to have the
	Firearms variation. In essence, this ability is related to the 
	legendary 'push-finger' techniques that some martial traditions once 
	claimed to teach- the mutant can harm his victims without ever making 
	physical contact with them.

	Note: In all cases, 'Dodge' refers to the standard Dex + Dodge rolls. 
	If the defending character has initiative and is aware of the
	attack, an Evasion (Wits + Dodge) is still possible at no penalty.

	Brawling- the mutant appears to outside observers to be shadow- boxing 
	or merely performing katas. In actual fact, he can brawl with any 
	opponent within his line of sight- without ever touching his opponent 
	or even coming within five feet. The blows are roughly directional (you 
	can't punch a fellow in the back while he's facing you) and the force 
	is exerted through progressively less space as the mutant goes up in 
	Rank in this Power- making it harder and harder for his opponents to
	dodge or block.

	¥ Normal difficulty to hit. Diff 7 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥ Diff 8 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥ Diff 9 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥¥ Diff 10 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥¥¥ No dodge is possible.  Note that evasions (Wits + Dodge) are
	still a possibility; the difficulty varies with the amount of available
	cover.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Fetch- Since your range is effectively line-of-sight, and you can
	attack anything from point-blank range to the edge of that range, you
	can grab objects that are WAY over there and drag them (through a
	series of dragging motions) or even carry them through the air, with
	Shadow Brawling.  That is, if you're strong enough to move these
	objects.
	¥¥ Pin- With this Stunt, you can exert continuous pressure through
	space, rather that just in bursts.  The upshot of this is that you can
	hold people down with this Power without having to move or twitch
	every few seconds to make sure that the Power keeps going.
	¥¥¥ Feelings- Rather than having to see the results of your attacks,
	this Stunt allows you to feel the object that you're fondling.  As
	soon as I figure out a use for this Stunt, I'll let you know.
	¥¥¥¥ Apportation- Shadow brawling exerts force through a kind of null-
	space or hyper-space.  The force is not expressed through all the
	intervening space between you and an object.  Here's the good news for
	you- any object that you can lift with the Fetch Stunt, you can move
	through this null-space to a new location.  Both the object's original
	location and its destination must be within line-of-sight, of course.

	Firearms- the mutant doesn't even need a gun! All he has to do is mime 
	the action of shooting someone. There will not be any immediate physical
	evidence that the target has been 'shot'- no open wounds for instance- 
	but this Power is fully capable of delivering lethal force. The damage 
	is calculated normally for a firearms attack.  Normal dodging rules 
	apply.

	¥ Diff 7 to hit. Damage rating is 3.
	¥¥ Diff 7 to hit. Damage rating is 4.
	¥¥¥ Diff 6 to hit. Damage rating is 4.
	¥¥¥¥ Diff 6 to hit. Damage rating is 5.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Diff 6 to hit. Damage rating is 6.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Ricochet*- With concentration, the mutant can harden his 'fire' to
	the point where it will ricochet off of objects such as walls, etc.-
	allowing the mutant to attempt to shoot surfaces that he can't see. 
	This is a double-cost Stunt, and the difficulty of the shot ranges
	from 8 to 10.  The mutant must be able to see all the surfaces that he
	wants the 'bullet' to bounce off of.
	¥¥¥ Armour Trivia- If you can see how thick the armour is on a target
	(this does not include the Power: Body Armour, but certainly applies
	to the equipment, as well as flak jackets, etc.) you can fire through
	it without leaving an entrance wound- effectively ignoring it.
	¥¥¥ Shotgun!- Lots of shotguns have two barrels.  You can have as many
	as ten with this Stunt.  Split your dice pool up (at least one die for
	each finger that you're using as a barrel) and go to town.  Don't
	botch, though... biofeedback is nasty (Stamina check, difficulty 7, is
	required to avoid loss of consciousness.  One round per 'one' is lost
	anyway due to pain).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Piercing Fire- requires the Stunt: Ricochet.  The mutant may, if
	desired, have his shadow-bullets carry their force through the target
	to destinations beyond.  After passing through a body, the bullet's new
	damage pool is equal to whatever the target did not soak.  Note that
	if the target has Body Armour, the damage pool will be reduced by it
	twice (once on the way in, once on the way out).
	
	Melee- the mutant doesn't even need a weapon! One sort of weapon is 
	mimicked by this Power- pick one from the WOD: Combat book or another
	supplement containing weapon statistics. The mutant must move as if he 
	were fighting with the weapon, so a dodge or parry is usually possible
	for his opponents- however, he does not have to stand within the 
	'reach' of the weapon to hit his foes.

	¥ Normal diffs for all maneuvers. Dodge or parry for opponents is 
	diff 8. Range is 5 feet.
	¥¥ Range is 10 feet.
	¥¥¥ Range is 15 feet. Dodge or parry for opponents diff 9.
	¥¥¥¥ Range is 20 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Range is 25 feet. Dodge or parry for opponents diff 10.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Diamond hardness- the mutant's Rank in this Power equates to the
	'hardness' of the weapon as per the Power: Matter Hardening with this
	Stunt.
	¥¥ Weightless- reduce the difficulty to hit with the weapon by one.

	Missiles- no weapon is required. The mutant needs merely to mime 
	throwing a missile (or releasing an arrow)- of which he has an 
	infinite supply.  Range and damage are normal for the missile, but it 
	is very difficult to dodge. Since each missile is also free from 
	such considerations as gravity and wind speed, it is also more accurate.
	Arrows, slings, boomerangs, throwing hatchets and the like can all
	be mimicked.

	¥ Normal difficulty to hit. Diff 8 to dodge the attack.  Damage rating
	and difficulty are as per the mimed weapon (from longbow to boomerang).
	¥¥ -1 diff to hit. Diff 8 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥ Diff 9 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥¥ -2 diff to hit. Diff 9 to dodge the attack.
	¥¥¥¥ Diff 10 to dodge the attack.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Exotic Missiles- if the mutant spends a point of Permanent Willpower,
	he may learn to use an exotic missile (such as a razor-edged boomerang,
	grenade, or bolas).  It will have the effects of any such 'real'
	missile, including explosive damage, entanglement, etc.
	¥¥¥ Impale- if the mutant successfully scores at least five successes
	to hit and three damage, the enemy is impaled or stunned, losing one
	action (or round's worth of actions, unless the victim spends Rage).
	Each extra damage success immobilizes the victim for an additional
	round.
	¥¥¥ Penetrating fire- the missile, if piercing, can carry on through
	a victim without loss of velocity if it inflicts at least three Health
	Levels of damage.  As soon as it fails to inflict this much damage on
	a target, it stops.
	¥¥¥ Reflecting fire- the missile, if blunt, can ricochet off of several
	persons or objects without loss of velocity if it inflicts at least
	three Health Levels of damage with each strike.  As soon as it fails to
	inflict this much damage, it stops.
	¥¥¥¥ Special delivery- the mutant may use his Shadow-Missiles as a
	trigger for any Power that has a range of touch.
	
	Tools- all manner of equipment such as hammers, screwdrivers, ropes,
	nets, even jackhammers (anything that can be directly manipulated by
	main force) can be simulated with this variation.  Range and damage are
	as normal for the tool (if it is capable of damage), but the mutant's
	effective Strength is increased while the shadow tools are being used.
	
	¥ The mutant's effective strength is the same.
	¥¥ Strength increases by two.
	¥¥¥ Strength increases by four.
	¥¥¥¥ Strength increases by six.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Strength increases by eight.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Power- Power tools such as rotary saws and the aforementioned
	jackhammers can be simulated with this Power.
	¥¥¥ In Mind- so long as the mutant continues a task with a shadow tool,
	he doesn't have to watch what he's doing.  This increases the
	difficulty of the task by two, but at least the tool doesn't vanish
	when the mutant breaks line of sight.
	¥¥¥ Prehensile- The 'ends' of flexible shadow tools like ropes and nets
	can be manipulated at a distance (tying knots or picking up the end of
	a net) as if the mutant had those ends in hand.

	Transport- the mutant has a shadow vehicle, summonable at will (and
	maintained with light concentration) that mimics the characteristics of
	a real-life mode of transport.  This vehicle (the mutant must choose
	one when he gets this Power) can mimic motorcycles, cars, trucks,
	boats, planes, or even steeds such as horses, camels, or water buffalo.
	Wonder Woman's invisible plane is not entirely dissimilar to the
	products of this Power.  If the transport is disrupted (loses its last
	Health Level), the mutant loses a point of Power Charge and must soak
	a Health Level of bashing damage.
	
	¥ The transport can move at up to 50 kph, with a stall speed (if it
	flies) of 15 kph.  It is fragile, and can not bear much weight-- it
	has a base of 2 points in Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina.  It also
	has three Health Levels.
	¥¥ The transport's speed increases to 100 kph with a stall speed of
	25 kph.  It has three points to assign to Strength, Dexterity, and
	Stamina.  A point can also be used to increase the transport's Health
	Levels.
	¥¥¥ The transport moves at 200 kph with a stall speed of 40 kph.  It
	receives two additional points for Attributes.
	¥¥¥¥ The transport moves at 500 kph with a stall speed of 75 kph.  It
	has three additional points for Attributes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The transport moves at up to 750 kph with a stall speed of 75
	kph.  It has three additional points of Attributes.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Hover- for flying transports only.  A shadow-helicopter can be made
	with this Stunt.  Ignore the statistics for stall speed.
	¥ Visible- the transport becomes dimly visible, like a smoky outline.
	The mutant can make it appear solid, transparent in the appropriate
	places but matte in others, by spending an additional point of Power
	Charge or Willpower.
	¥¥¥ Attack- for shadow-steeds only.  The mutant can direct the steed
	to attack with whatever 'natural' appendages it might have (hooves,
	claws, horns, etc.) using its Attributes and the mutant's Animal Ken
	score in place of Brawl.  It inflicts bashing damage.
	
Shadow Manipulation/Darkforce Control* (Social) [AL]
	Shadow is not just the absence of the light.  A shadow has an essence,
	a force.  It is an aggressive emptiness, an intrusive darkness, an
	enveloping cold.  Mutants who manipulate shadows are rarely trusted
	just because of the emotions that are invoked by them.  It has been
	hinted that Penance may have this Power.  Roll Manipulation +
	Shadow Manipulation, or Dexterity + Directed Blast.
	
	¥ The mutant may generate static shadow-based illusions (no colour
	lighter than a dark blue) and deliver one point of cold damage by
	amplifying the darkness in a shadow.  An extra die for all Stealth
	dice pools involving shadow, and maybe Intimidation if used 
	creatively.
	¥¥ The mutant may generate moving shadow-based illusions (dim and
	greyish, but any colour is possible) and cause up to two points of
	cold damage.  Light may be actively attacked and stifled by an
	application of a higher-rank shadow.  Two extra dice for Stealth.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can give the shadows a semi-solid consistency,
	allowing them to attack (One Health Level, one die of Strength,
	Dexterity, and Stamina per success, the mutant's Brawl score) or
	create shadow weapons that do one less die of damage than normal,
	or make them impenetrable to normal light (thus they can be
	used as a shield against light attacks).  Three points of cold
	damage.
	¥¥¥¥ Shadows now become active and hungry, attacking characters
	that walk by, seeking those with high Willpower, Gnosis, Rage,
	Pathos, Quintessence, Actual Power Level, etc. in order that
	they might feed on the victim's 'light'.  The shadows have four
	Health Levels, one die of Strength, Dex, Sta per success, and
	cause aggravated damage.  Shadow weapons can be made that do
	normal damage + 1 die of cold damage.  Three extra dice for
	Stealth rolls.  Four points of cold damage.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can turn her own body into shadow, making it
	difficult to injure with physical and cold attacks (-2 diff to
	soak) but rendering it particularly vulnerable to light and heat
	attacks (+2 diff to soak).  Stealth diffs are reduced by three.
	The mutant can travel through the tiniest cracks.  Five points
	of cold damage.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Dampen E-M Radiation- not just visible light, but any 
	electro-magnetic radiation may be dampened and stifled with this
	Stunt, as long as the Shadow Manipulation is of higher Rank.
	¥¥¥ Deaden sound- any sound of up to two Ranks less intensity
	than the mutant's Rank in this Power may be stifled.

Shapeshifting (Physical) [AL]
	This is not a power to be toyed with.  Although several characters, such
	as Mystique, have limited versions of this ability, Morph has the most
	robust version.  With it, the mutant can impersonate people and even
	objects with a fair chance of remaining undetected.  Though such things
	as super-strength and death-rays can't truly be imitated by this power,
	wings, gills, and other structures can easily be made if the mutant has
	the necessary know-how.  The real limiting factor is the ability to change
	mass (and thus volume).  In the end, it is still easier for smaller
	shapeshifters to imitate small things, and larger shapeshifters to imitate
	large things.  Imitation of voices, mannerisms, etc. is usually governed
	by the Mimicry and Acting talents, since the changes involved are too
	fine for the voluntary sort of changes that this Power involves.  See
	the Physical Imitation power as well.  In combination with the powers
	Mass-Shifting and Size-Shifting, this power can be downright lethal.
	Roll Stamina + Shapeshifting, difficulty equal to the Rank required
	for the effect + 4.
	
	¥ The mutant is able to impersonate people of roughly his size.  Minor
	changes (skin colour, acne condition, etc.) can be made with no real
	effort.  Objects of roughly the same mass and volume can also be
	impersonated (tables, plump chairs, etc.) though the temperature of the
	object and its texture will probably strike tactile observers as curious.
	Objects must be of uniform composition to be imitated effectively.  The
	change will take at least a minute if you want it to be a good job.
	¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about 30 pounds of mass, and change around
	his internal body structure at will, if he knows what he is doing.  Thus,
	wings can be grown, and the heart can be moved a few inches up or down
	in the chest.  Body temperature can be varied by as much as 10 degrees
	Celsius, and texture imitation becomes more realistic.  The mutant can
	start to imitate more complex objects and can change the way that his
	body reacts to light (he can become reflective- though not yet
	transparent) rather than be limited to simple colour changes.  The change
	will take three rounds or so if you want it to be a good job.  This is
	the level where the mutant can grow simple body structures like gills,
	if he has a fish physiology text in front of him.
	¥¥¥ More complex objects can be imitated- ones with inconstant temperature
	and moving parts (like a fridge- though it'd be a $#& warm fridge).  The
	mutant can add or shed about 70 pounds of mass.  Transparency, refractive
	index, etc. can be mucked about with (provided the mutant understands the
	principle involved).  Temperature can be varied by as much as 20 Celsius
	degrees without harm.  The texture is just about indistinguishable from
	the real thing.  Changes usually take about a round.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about 120 pounds of mass, and vary his
	temperature by as much as 30 degrees Celsius.  Any biological change
	that the mutant can conceive of can be attempted, though he had better
	get it right...  Changes take an action.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about 200 pounds of mass, and vary his
	temperature by as much as 50 degrees Celsius.  Boffo.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can add or shed about 500 pounds of mass, and vary
	his temperature by as much as 70 degrees.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about 1000 pounds of mass, and vary
	his temperature by up to 100 degrees.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about a ton of mass, and vary his
	temperature by up to 120 degrees.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about two tons of mass, and vary
	his temperature by up to 150 degrees.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can add or shed about five tons of mass, and
	vary his temperature by up to 200 degrees.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Take the True Form- the mutant can revert to his original body at
	will, without taking an action to do so.
	¥¥ AbsolŸt- the mutant's change of state is absolute, which means that
	he will probably never grow old, and will not revert to 'form' when he
	loses consciousness.
	¥¥ Just a Flesh Wound- the mutant may take an action (as a Dodge) to
	shift her vital organs around to make a hit less damaging.  She adds
	her rank in Shapeshifting to her Stamina pool for soaking the attack.
	¥¥ Scent State- the mutant can change his smell.  The better his
	perceptual acuity, the closer he can come to imitating the smell of an
	object.  Note that if he wears cologne, the mutant can't change how
	THAT smells- though on a hot date, he could imitate the smell of
	cologne...
	¥¥¥ Quick Healing- simply close the wound!  Remake your body so that it
	no longer features that pesky cut.  The mutant, as an shapeshifting
	action (that is, taking the amount of time normally associated with
	shapeshifting) can heal his Shapeshifting rank in Health Levels as long
	as he is conscious.
	¥¥¥ Sharp- the mutant can actually create body weaponry.  This weaponry
	is not as effective as the real stuff, and has one less damage die in
	the pool than the 'standard' version.  (No projectile weapons can be
	imitated).  Its difficulty is standard (a created longsword would be
	diff. 6 to wield, rather than 5, as the Body Weaponry Power would
	confer).  If the mutant botches a Dex + Melee roll using this weapon,
	he will be forced to soak one Health Level of damage for every one
	rolled, and the weapon will be ruined (until he makes another).
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can purchase the power: Elastic Body, even if he did
	not start the game with that power.

Singularity (Physical/Social) [PN]
	Like Rachel Summers, the daughter of Cyclops and Phoenix, the mutant
	is one-of-a-kind, absolutely unique.  In other words, only one version
	of the mutant exists in all the multiverse (at least in a given time).
	She cannot be cloned.  Moreover, it is impossible to bring past or
	future versions of the mutant into a time where she already exists. 
	All such attempts fail.  No alternate versions of her exist in other
	dimensions.  No roll is required.

	Variation: Unique*- not only is the mutant singular, it is also much
	more difficult to impersonate her than it is for normal people.  The
	mutant is immune to True Mimicry, Blood Kinship, Physical Imitation,
	and Psychic Template.  She can't take the Power: Duplication.  All
	attempts to mimic her physical appearance or voice (by illusion,
	shapeshifting, or even through the use of recording devices, costumes,
	or psychic powers) give all viewers who are even slightly familiar
	with the subject (having seen her on the street, for instance) an
	Intelligence check (difficulty 4) to recognize the deception.
	
	¥ The mutant is absolutely the one and only version of herself. 
	Accept no imitations.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Beyond Change- The mutant may purchase the Power: Immutable Pattern
	with Experience.

Sizeshifting (Physical) [AL]
	This is either the ability to grow very large or very small.  The mutant
	must purchase both variations to do both.  The various Goliaths and
	Giant Men were able to grow large, while the Wasp, the Yellowjackets,
	and the various Ant-Men had the ability to grow small.  Either variation
	has its advantages, not least in combat.  In any case, the Rank of the
	power determines the extent of the mutant's ability to increase or
	decrease his volume.  The mutant's mass increases in proper proportion
	(thus, a sizeshifter who grew to twice his height, width, and depth would
	weigh eight times as much as before).  The minimum Strength is always one.
	Roll Stamina + Sizeshifting, difficulty 6.
	
	Variation: Object Shifting- the mutant can size-shift objects, rather
	than his own body.  This makes this Power a Social one, rather than a
	Physical one.  Other people so affected get a Stamina check (difficulty
	of 4 + the mutant's Rank in this Power); certain 'special' objects
	might also attempt to resist.  This form of size-shifting is impermanent,
	lasting no more than one hour per success.  Size-shifting others will
	require physical contact.
	
	Special Flaw: Stuck in Form (2-6 point Flaw)- the mutant is permanently
	the size dictated by his Power Rank, and cannot actively change at all.
	The point value of the Flaw is equal to the Rank of the Power + 1.
	
	Special Flaw: The Bigger They Are, the Smarter They Ain't (2-4 point
	Flaw)- like Maul, the Mutant's Intelligence decreases as his size
	increases.  The mutant's Intelligence drops one rank for every size
	category he grows (Min. 1).  For four points, in addition to the
	Intelligence loss, the difficulties for all Willpower rolls increase by
	one per size category (Max. 10).  If a character with Mega- Int takes
	this flaw, that power is negated when he activates his Size Shifting,
	in addition to the effects described above.
	
	¥ The mutant can grow or shrink by a factor of 20% (a six-foot man would
	grow or shrink by about 14 inches).  If he is growing, the mutant gains
	one point of Strength and a Health Level.  If he is shrinking, the mutant
	loses a point of Strength.
	¥¥ The mutant can grow or shrink by a factor of 50% (about three feet for
	a six-foot tall person).  Growth means that the mutant gets two points of
	Strength and two Health Levels.  However, difficulties to hit him are 
	decreased by one.  If he is shrinking, he loses two points of Strength,
	and difficulties to hit him are increased by one.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can grow by a factor of 100% (doubled size) or shrink by
	75% (quartered size).  If growing, the mutant gets four points of Strength,
	one point of Stamina, and three Health Levels, and the difficulties to hit
	him are decreased by one.  If shrinking, the mutant loses three points of
	Strength, and diffs to hit him are increased by two.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can grow by a factor of 200% (tripled size) or shrink by
	90%.  If growing, the mutant gets six points of Strength, two points of
	Stamina, and four Health Levels, and the difficulties to hit him are
	decreased by two.  If he is shrinking, the mutant loses four points of
	Strength, and diffs to hit him are increased by three.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can grow by a factor of 400% (quintuple size) or shrink
	by as much as 95%.  If growing, the mutant gets ten points of Strength,
	four points of Stamina, and five Health Levels, and the difficulties to hit
	him are decreased by three.  If he is shrinking, the mutant loses five
	points of Strength, and diffs to hit him are increased by four.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can grow to ten times his original size, or shrink by
	as much as 99%.  If growing, the mutant gets twelve points of Strength,
	six points of Stamina, and six Health Levels, and diffs to hit him are
	reduced by four.  If he is shrinking, the mutant loses six points of
	Strength, and diffs to hit him are increased by five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ The mutant can grow up to twelve times his original size, or
	shrink to a microscopic level.  The mutant gets twelve points of Strength
	and eight points of Stamina, along with seven Health Levels, if growing,
	and diffs to hit him are reduced to two.  If shrinking, the mutant is
	too small to cause normal damage, and two small to be targeted by normal
	attacks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant can grow up to fourteen times his size, or shrink to
	such an extent that he enters another reality (the Microverse).  He
	gets twelve points of Strength, ten points of Stamina, and eight Health
	Levels if growing.  If shrinking, the mutant is shrunk to an appropriate
	size for his new reality.  No stat changes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant can grow up to sixteen times his size, or shrink to
	Rank five effect in the Microverse.  He gets twelve points of Strength
	and Stamina, and ten Health Levels if growing.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Overload!  The mutant becomes the size of a planetoid if
	growing.  Strength and Stamina incalculable, but he is catastrophically
	ejected from the planet and left to float in the icy depths of space.
	If shrinking, he can reduce to Rank seven ability in the Microverse.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Variation- the mutant may purchase another variation of this Power
	with Experience points for half cost initially.
	¥¥ Elongation- requires the Object Shifting variation.  The mutant may
	expand an object in one dimension rather than in three (up to four times
	as long as normal).
	¥¥ Permanence- the character may purchase the 'Stuck in Form' flaw, if
	desired, as a Power Stunt.  No freebies or Experience accrue to the
	mutant in so doing.  This is particularly desirable for those with the
	Object Shifting variation.
	¥¥¥¥ Lapse- requires the Object Shifting variation.  The mutant may
	choose to delay the size shift by as much as one minute (six rounds)
	per success.  The length of elapsed time is decided at the time the
	dice are rolled.

Social Chameleon (Mental) [AL]
	A mutant with this Power can seamlessly fit in with any social
	situation. Part telepathy, part empathy, part intuition, this Power
	can offer uncanny insights into the social dynamic of any group.  It
	is relatively easy to detect a group's leader using this Power, or to
	gauge the mood of a person or persons.  Strangers will instinctually
	accept the mutant as one of their "kind of people".  The standard
	system rolls for this Power are Perception + Social Chameleon and
	Manipulation + Social Chameleon.  This is a subtle Power, like
	Persuasion, and will tend to fail if it is flailed about like a club.
	
	¥ The mutant can immediately set people at ease.  He appears to be at
	home at high tea as well as in waterfront pubs.  The skill Etiquette
	may be purchased at a cost of 1 x current.
	¥¥ Members of private groups will feel compelled to offer specialized
	information that will help the mutant get by.  Niggling worries on the
	part of unsuspecting victims will usually be allayed by internal
	rationalization.
	¥¥¥ People will tend to overlook or forget blunders on the part of the
	mutant (like wearing a disco suit to a funeral), seeing nothing
	unusual about the mutant's behavior.  Of course, if he commits a major
	faux pas (like calling the Queen nasty names, or killing someone), he
	must still suffer the consequences.
	¥¥¥¥ People will tend to forget having met the mutant before (if they
	are meeting in different circumstances) or "remember" having met him
	before, with a little prompting.
	¥¥¥¥¥ People will actually "see" the mutant as someone else (who might
	have a good reason to be there), even if the mutant does not resemble
	the person that he is taken for.  They will tend not to speak to
	others about the mutant.

Sound Absorption and Conversion (Social) [AN]
	Dazzler, formerly of the X-Men, has the ability to absorb sounds and
	convert them into light.  There are a variety of other things that
	sound can be converted into as well, and this can be an extremely
	deadly power, since sound is everywhere.  The maximum amount of energy
	that can be absorbed safely is equal to the mutant's Power Rank.  If
	the mutant has the Power Stunt: Store Sound, he can store sound up
	to his maximum level and still absorb that again without damage;
	however, this latter energy must be released within one round or it
	will damage the mutant normally.  Any sound that strikes the mutant
	over and above this will harm him normally.  No roll is normally
	required.
	
	¥ One point of damage is automatically absorbed and converted.
	¥¥ Two points
	¥¥¥ Three points
	¥¥¥¥ Four points
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five points

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen points
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen points

	Common Variations:
	* Strength Conversion- the mutant gets a temporary point of Strength
	for every Health level of damage he absorbs.  His maximum Strength
	level is 5 + his Power Rank in this Power.  This Strength lasts one
	scene.
	* Stamina Conversion- like Strength conversion.
	* Health Conversion- the mutant heals a Health Level of normal damage
	for every point absorbed, or a Level of aggravated damage for every
	two points.  This includes 'overlap damage' that he does not soak.
	* Energy Conversion- if the mutant has an energy emission power, he can
	add an automatic damage success for every point absorbed.  If not, this
	effect duplicates the energy emission power, save that the mutant does
	not generate energy unconsciously.  Dex + Directed Blast to hit.
	
	Many Power Stunts associated with this Power are possible; they are
	related to the nature of the conversion.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Store Sound- the mutant can store up to his Rank in sound to be
	used later, and still absorb that many health levels again without
	damage.
	¥¥ Release Sound- requires the Stunt: Store Sound.  Rather than 
	converting stored sounds, the mutant may choose to release them (as
	if she had recorded them and was playing them back).  The volume
	may not be the same as the original if the entire sound was not
	absorbed.

Sound Emission (Social) [AL]
	This is not merely the ability to speak or make any kind of noise.  This
	is the ability to make a BIG noise.  Banshee, Siryn, Black Bolt, and the
	Black Canary (I know she's DC, but I like her) have/had this power.
	
	The attack roll (Dex + Directed Blast), if it is successful, allows for
	a damage test equal to two dice for every Rank in Sound Emission, if
	appropriate.  The difficulty to soak is six (normal).  There is also the
	question of collateral damage.
	
	Variation: Non-Verbal Sound Emission- by clapping your hands or merely
	by concentrating, you create the sound.  No vocal chords required to
	execute this one, baby.  Costs two extra Freebie Points or Experience
	points on initial purchase.

	Special Flaw: Full Tilt (1 or 4-point Flaw): The mutant cannot vary the
	amount of sound he emits; it is always a full-strength blast for
	him.  Black Bolt has this Flaw.  This means that you cannot even talk
	unless you bought the Non-Verbal variation of this power.  In that
	case, the flaw is worth only one point.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Resistance to sound- this is an automatic soak success against any sort
	of sound damage.  Each point of emission = an automatic soak success.
	¥ Perfect Pitch- the mutant can pick his frequency, basically, and will
	have an enormous range to choose from.
	¥ Protected Hearing- the mutant can purchase the Power: Altered Perceptions
	(Protected Hearing) with Experience for half-cost.
	¥ Heightened Hearing- the mutant can purchase the Power: Altered Perceptions
	(Heightened Hearing) with Experience for half-cost.
	¥ High and Low- the mutant can hear sounds that are well outside the normal
	range of human hearing, both above and below.
	¥¥ Sonar- requires the Power: Altered Perceptions (Heightened Hearing).
	The mutant may purchase the Power: Altered Perceptions (Sonar) with Exp.
	for half cost.  His range, of course, will be much better than the normal.
	¥¥ Vibration Resistance- the mutant has an automatic point of soak vs. any
	Vibration attack per Rank of this power.
	¥¥ Vocalize- like Siryn, a mutant with this Stunt may use a sonic scream
	(at high decibel output) and simultaneously speak, if desired, at a normal
	tone of voice.  This effect only works if the mutant is screaming above or
	below the range that humans can hear.  Requires the Stunt: Perfect Pitch.
	¥¥¥ Control- a mutant with sound emission powers can buy vibration control
	with experience points, even if he didn't start with this ability, once
	he buys this power stunt.
	¥¥¥ Kamikaze Blast- the mutant can add a health level of damage to his
	attack for every health level he takes (this is soakable)- this will
	likely render the mutant unconscious from the effort.  (Three Willpower
	successes are required to avoid)
	¥¥¥ Knockout- the mutant can stun or render unconscious his foes using
	this stunt.  Requires the Stunt: Perfect Pitch.  Foes must make a Stamina
	roll (diff 5 + the mutant's Rank) in order to stay awake or avoid losing
	an action.
	¥¥¥¥ Fear- emotional responses, such as nervousness or fear, can be
	evoked from certain low-frequency sounds.  Requires the Stunts: Perfect
	Pitch and High and Low.  For every success the mutant gets on a Sound
	Emission roll (diff 9) everyone else loses a die from all dice pools
	the following round.
	¥¥¥¥ Hypnotic Voice- the mutant may purchase the Power: Hypnosis with the
	Hypnotic Voice variation with Experience.

Space Anchor (Social) / Immovability (Physical) [AL]
	This power is the ability to 'plant' yourself and make it very difficult
	for others to move you.  This can be done by reference to pure mass, as
	the Blob does it, or by anchoring yourself to the fabric of space, which
	will make it very difficult to budge you even if you are small.  In order
	to move you or even make you wobble slightly, an enormous number of
	Strength successes are required, especially at high Rank.  No roll is
	required, though an action must be taken to 'set' yourself.
	
	Variation: Object Anchoring (Social)- instead of anchoring yourself to
	the fabric of space, you can anchor yourself to an object, such as a
	train or a rock.  It requires the standard amount of force to move you,
	but if the object is moved, you're going along.
	
	¥ Your opponents require a number of successes equal to your Strength
	plus two in order to budge you.
	¥¥ Strength plus four
	¥¥¥ Strength plus eight
	¥¥¥¥ Strength plus sixteen
	¥¥¥¥¥ Strength plus thirty-two
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Strength plus sixty-four
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ No force can move the mutant
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Stay! (Space Anchor Stunt)- the mutant has the ability to anchor
	others as well as himself, which allows you to immobilize them against
	their will as long as you maintain concentration.
	¥¥¥¥ Rapid Transit- if the mutant has the Space Anchor variation of this
	power, he can anchor himself to a reference point above the ground and
	let the earth move underneath him.  The mutant will be moving at about
	1,000 miles per hour, so he'd better be able to take the punishment that
	solid objects are going to dish out if he isn't very far above the ground.

Spirit Armour (Mental) [AN]
	As with all powers that have their source in spirit, this is not one
	that is commonly encountered.  To shamans or other mutants who may have
	to deal with hostile supernatural forces on a regular basis, it is
	invaluable.  The mutant's aura is hardened, such that it becomes a
	palpable force.  It is even visible under certain circumstances, 
	appearing as a reddish discolouration of the air.  It may flash
	briefly under assault.  No roll is required.
	
	¥ Spirit armour is worth one automatic soak vs. energy or supernatural
	attacks.  Here, 'supernatural' refers to magic, gnosis-fueled abilities
	of any sort, or spirit charms.
	¥¥ Two automatic soak vs. energy or supernatural attacks.
	¥¥¥ Three automatic soak vs. energy or supernatural attacks.
	¥¥¥¥ Four automatic soak vs. energy or supernatural attacks.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five automatic soak vs. energy or supernatural attacks.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Gnosis Flare- the mutant may increase his defense against physical
	attacks (which are otherwise unaffected by spirit armour) by spending
	a point of Gnosis.  This offers one extra soak die per rank, and
	lasts for one scene.

Spirit Channeling (Mental) [AL]
	This is not a common power, and it requires the power: Gnosis if the
	mutant does not want to burn off all of his Willpower using it.  With
	this ability, the mutant can channel the special attributes of various
	spirit animals (such as Bear, Wolverine, Deer, and Wolf) in order to
	augment his natural abilities.  The most obvious Attributes that can
	be augmented are:
		Strength (Bear, Bull, Stag, Elephant, etc.)
		Dexterity (Weasel, Mongoose, Snake, Puma, etc.)
		Stamina (Wolf, Muskox, Tern, Shark, etc.)
		Perception (Eagle, Wolf, Deer, etc.)
	while the most obvious Abilities that can be augmented are:
		Alertness (Deer, Rabbit, etc.)
		Dodge (Mongoose, Swallow, Flea, etc.)
		Enigmas (Tortoise, Lynx, etc.)
		Primal Urge (Wolf, Bear, Shark, Tiger, etc.)
		Sewer Lore (Rat)
		Stealth (Wolf, Puma, Fox, etc.)
		Swimming (Shark)
		Tracking (Wolf, Puma, etc.)
	and, if the mutant does happen to have the appropriate power:
		Rage (Wolverine, Shark, etc.)
		
	Channeling is a risky business, but it can obviously be profitable.  The
	mutant spends a point of Gnosis (or Willpower, if he does not have Gnosis)
	and spends a round attempting to commune with the appropriate spirit.  At
	the end of the round, the mutant rolls Charisma + Animal Ken, difficulty 8.
	If he has spent Gnosis, the difficulty is only 7.  If the roll succeeds,
	the mutant gets one point per Rank in the area that he wanted to improve
	(be it an Attribute or an Ability).  This lasts a scene or until the mutant
	tries to channel another animal.  On a botch, the spirit may decide (at the
	ST's discretion) to attempt to possess the body of the mutant (contested
	Willpower rolls, diff 6) or wreak some other form of havoc for the offense
	that the mutant has given.
	
	It is possible to channel spirits other than animal spirits, but this is
	very risky, and the effects of a successful channeling are unpredictable
	with some spirits.  The roll is Charisma + Spirit Lore, and the difficulty
	is nine.  The mutant must have some specific type of spirit in mind when
	attempting this (a Sphinx, a Pain-Spirit, etc.).  With some of the spirits
	that you can channel, the thought of botching this roll is too horrible to
	contemplate.
	
	In all cases, the mutant's Attributes or Abilities cannot be improved past
	his (Actual Power Level + 3).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Totem- if the mutant has successfully channeled one particular spirit
	several times (at least 5) and has never offended it, he may attempt to
	make that spirit his Totem.  This requires a Charisma + Spirit Lore roll
	(difficulty 10) as the mutant makes a nice bit of oratory to explain to
	the spirit why this special relationship should be developed.  Only one
	spirit can be a mutant's Totem.  In any case, if the mutant is successful
	in convincing the spirit to be his Totem, his difficulty in channeling it
	is reduced to 4.  However, the difficulty of channeling all other spirits
	is increased by 1, and the mutant loses the ability to channel the spirits
	that are the enemy of his Totem.  It is customary for a Totem to offer some
	gift or power to its follower (see Werewolf: the Apocalypse for examples
	of how Totems work).

Spirit Prison (Mental) [AL]
	Like a fetish, a mutant with this Power has a field of spiritual energy
	inside his body.  There are several implications of this fact, but the
	most common application of it is the ability to trap spirits of all
	types (including ghosts and demons) in his body.  Spirits have a -2
	difficulty to attempt to 'skinride' or possess the character (his body
	will seem very inviting), but once inside, they will find it difficult
	to exert their will, and difficult to leave.  Like Puck of Alpha
	Flight, the mutant can use this Power in a variety of ways.  If the
	mutant already has as many spirits as he can hold and another spirit
	attempts to possess him, then the mutant can choose to force him out or
	to expel one of the old spirits in order to hold the new one.  
	Capturing and holding a powerful spirit has been known to warp the body
	of people with this Power.  Roll Dexterity + Spirit Prison to trap the
	spirit initially- the spirit can Dodge this attack normally.
	
	¥ The mutant can hold one spirit at a time.  When the spirit has been
	trapped, a one-time contested Willpower check is made (difficulty of
	the spirit's Willpower- the spirit's diff is the mutant's Willpower).
	If the spirit loses, it is trapped, impotent, until the mutant runs out
	of temporary Willpower.  If the spirit and the mutant tie, then the
	spirit is forcibly expelled from the mutant's body, realizing the danger
	of attempting another possession.  If the mutant loses, well...
	¥¥ The mutant can hold two spirits at a time.
	¥¥¥ Three spirits
	¥¥¥¥ Four spirits
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five spirits
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven spirits
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Nine spirits
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eleven spirits
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Thirteen spirits
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen spirits
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Channel Charm- in an emergency, the mutant can attempt to use one of
	the Charms (or Arcanoi, or whatever) of one of the trapped spirits by
	expending a point of Willpower.  This allows the spirit another chance
	(contested Willpower check) to escape or dominate the character, at -1
	difficulty per level of the Arcanos or per 3 Power points in the Charm.
	¥¥ Shell Transformation- the mutant with this Stunt can take on the
	Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina) of one of the
	spirits trapped within him, if it has a materialized form.  This can
	be switched between his natural stats and those of each of the spirits
	within with the expenditure of a Willpower point.  This may entail a
	change in Appearance, as well.  Roll Stamina + Spirit Prison, diff 7.
	¥¥¥ Spirit Channeling- requires the Stunt: Channel Charm.  The mutant
	may purchase the Power: Spirit Channeling with Experience points.
	¥¥¥ Spirit Vacuum- the mutant can try to 'suck in' a spirit in the
	immediate area against its will.  The spirit must be within 5 feet per
	Rank of this Power, and gets a Willpower check to resist the vacuum
	effect (even before the Willpower check normally associated with this
	Power).  This is a Manipulation + Spirit Prison and no Dodge is
	possible.

Spirit Weaponry (Mental) [AL]
	The Marauder, Harpoon, has this rare and deadly power.  He employed it 
	against the Morlocks and X-Men during the Morlock Massacre.  Spirit
	Weaponry is an extension of the character's soul, and will bypass mere
	body armour and forcefields to injure the target's spirit. 
	Invulnerability is still an effective defense, as is a Psychic Field,
	but there are few other means of protecting yourself against Spirit
	Weaponry.  It can either be a melee or a missile weapon, and is soaked
	with Charisma instead of Stamina.  Each time the mutant calls up this
	power for a scene costs him a Willpower point. 
	
	¥ Weapon inflicts Manipulation + 1 damage
	¥¥ Weapon inflicts Man + 2 damage
	¥¥¥ Weapon does Man + 3 damage
	¥¥¥¥ Weapon does Man + 4 damage
	¥¥¥¥¥ Weapon does Man + 5 damage
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Damage of Man + 6, drains a Willpower point.  The victim soaks
	the damage first, and each extra success will prevent the loss of a
	point of Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Damage of Man + 7, drains two Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Damage of Man + 8, drains three Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Damage of Man + 9, drains four Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Damage of Man + 10, drains five Willpower.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Attack Spirit- If the mutant has the ability to perceive spirits,
	they may be attacked using spirit weaponry.
	¥ Gnosis Flare- If the mutant has the Gnosis power, he may spend one
	point of Gnosis for an automatic damage success.
	¥¥¥ Draining Wound- victims must spend a point of Willpower for each
	Health Level to be restored when wounded by this Power.  Note that the
	victim heals at the normal rate, but must spend a point of Willpower
	at the appropriate time to actually restore a Health Level.
	¥¥¥ Host- if the mutant has a normal weapon, he may spend a point of
	Gnosis to transform it into Spirit Weaponry.  Such weaponry has a
	physical presence and adds the mutant's Strength to the damage pool.
	However, this 'host' weapon is consumed when a successful blow is
	struck.
	¥¥¥¥ Wounded Spirit- victims can not heal (or be healed of) damage from
	the mutant's spirit weaponry so long as they do not have full
	Willpower.

Split Mind (Mental) [AL]
	Similar in many ways to the Power: Psychic Template, this is the
	ability to create a duplicate of one's own mind- within his own
	mind!  While only one of these selves has the ability to control the
	body, they may both operate at once - especially in the use of
	mental Powers such as Telepathy and Telekinesis.  In essence, the
	mutant gets one free mental Power action per turn, in addition to
	anything else he wants to do.  The act of splitting the mind is an
	Intelligence + Split Mind (diff 6) and lasts one scene. Only two
	minds can exist at one time.
	
	¥¥ The mutant can split his mind in two.  
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Advantage Well- with the expenditure of a point of Power Charge,
	the mutant may give each of his minds its own expendable Advantage
	pools-- Willpower, Gnosis, and Rage (if the latter two are
	appropriate).  Each mind gets the full allotment of points available
	in each of the pools-- they are not split, but when the minds are
	rejoined, the pools are also rejoined.  The new total of expendable
	points are the average between the two split pools.  Note that each
	mind can only spend points from its own pool.  Power Charge cannot
	be split in this way.
	¥¥ Dual Check- the mutant gets two Intelligence checks whenever she
	is required to make one.
	¥¥ Dual Initiative- requires the Stunt: Dual Check.  The mutant may
	roll twice for initiative, if desired (once for each mind), and the
	action of each mind falls at the appropriate time.
	¥¥ Dual Resist- requires the Stunts: Dual Check and Resist Attack.
	If the mutant fails a Willpower check, the other mind may elect to
	spend a point of Willpower to 'rescue' the first mind.
	¥¥ Dual View- requires the Stunt: Dual Check.  The mutant gets two
	Perception checks whenever required to make one.
	¥¥ Resist Attack- if one of the mutant's minds is overcome by pain
	or a psychic attack, the other can take over the body immediately.
	¥¥ Shed Mind- there is no distinction between the two minds, once
	this Power is in effect.  The mutant may "throw out" a problematic
	mind with this Stunt (one that is now insane, mind-controlled, etc.)
	It will take another action to split the remaining mind.

Summoning (Mental) [AH]
	This is the ability to call some kind of living (or at least sentient
	and mobile) creature to the mutant.  Normally, this is a spirit of 
	some kind, but the Vulture has the ability to summon birds, for
	instance.  Any creature of the proper type within range must make a
	Willpower check (diff 3 + the Rank of this Power) or move towards the
	mutant's location at maximum reasonable speed.  What it does when it
	gets there is its own business, of course...  After the call is sent
	out, no further concentration is required.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Animal Summoning- this can be of one animal type at a time (normal
	cost) or one type, period (get back three Freebie points after initial
	purchase, or costs only Seven experience points).
	* Dead Summoning- works on any wraiths in the area, though Vampires
	may also be affected (they make their Willpower checks at -2 diff)
	* Demon Summoning*- usually a Bad Idea(tm).  The demon will cross the
	dimensional barrier at the behest of the mutant, but it must be within
	range on the other side of the dimensional barrier (that is, on the
	nearest analogue of the mutant's position in the other dimension).
	* Elemental Summoning*- requires the Power: Gnosis.  Similar to the
	summoner in Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series, the mutant can summon
	an elemental exemplar at the cost of one point of Gnosis, who will
	cross the dimensional barrier and blast his foes.  (if the mutant
	knows the names of enough elementals, he can attack with a variety of
	energy and matter effects. Damage pool is three dice per Rank, and you
	may ignore the ranges below).  Such creatures stay for only one round.
	* Emotion Summoning- the mutant summons anyone who is feeling a
	particular emotion- either one specified in the summoning (normal
	cost) or one only (get back three Freebie points or three Experience
	points after initial purchase).
	* Man/Woman Summoning- the mutant can either summon members of the
	same sex or the opposite sex.
	* Mutant Summoning- any mutants in the area will hear the call.
	* Spirit Summoning- any spirit in the area (including wraiths, but
	not demons) must make the trip.  They must be in the Penumbra (or the
	nearest equivalent) unless the mutant is at least Rank 8 in this
	Power, and they cannot, of themselves, cross the dimensional barrier.
	
	¥ The range of the Power is one mile.
	¥¥ Five miles.
	¥¥¥ Twenty miles.
	¥¥¥¥ 100 miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ 500 miles.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere on the planet
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in the dimension
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Anywhere across the dimensions; a dimensional gate will open
	to allow summoned creatures to pass.

Symbol Evocation (Social) [AL]
	This Power allows the mutant to manipulate objects that have symbolic
	meaning and bring those meanings to life.  A mutant who had a Tarot
	deck could draw a card- for instance, The Tower- and suffer ruinous
	bad luck, or perhaps he could draw The Empress- and be rescued by
	Storm, who was happening by.  Or, he could draw The Empress reversed-
	and attract the attentions of the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club.
	Such is the way that his luck can go.  Dice, trigrams, and other
	divination methods are also effective for the purposes of this Power;
	the more rich the object is in symbolic meaning, the more possible
	effects the Evocation can come up with.  The mutant may either cast
	for himself (as above) or for others, including his enemies.  There
	are a number of restrictions:
	 
	* The object must have some element of chance in it, or the effects
	will be greatly reduced.
	* The mutant cannot 'fix' this chance without reducing the effects.
	
	The mutant spends at least one point of Willpower to activate this
	Power.  The more points he spends at one cast, the more potent the
	effects.  The mutant can keep pulling cards or rolling dice after
	spending the Willpower- so long as he does not change the target
	of his Power.  Of course, the Willpower assignment stays the same,
	so a draw (four Willpower invested) of The World may well seem to
	be fine indeed... so long as you do not draw Death right afterwards.
	
	¥ The mutant can spend one Willpower
	¥¥ Two Willpower
	¥¥¥ Three Willpower
	¥¥¥¥ Four Willpower
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Willpower

Sympathetic Power (Mental) [AH]
	The mutant can establish a sympathetic link between one object and
	another closely related object.  This link lasts as long as the mutant
	can sustain concentration, and can be used to heal or harm.  The
	strength of the link depends on how close the relationship between the
	two objects is.  Voodoo magic works in this way.  Roll Manipulation +
	Sympathetic Power to establish the link, and spend a point of Willpower.
	
	¥ Range of 50 feet
	¥¥ Range of 1 mile
	¥¥¥ Range of 5 miles
	¥¥¥¥ Range of 100 miles
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on the planet
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere in the solar system
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in the galaxy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Anywhere in the universe
	
	Any damage, healing, etc. that the sympathetic object (often called the
	fetish object) is subjected to crosses the link to visit itself upon
	the target.  The target's ability to resist this damage depends on its
	relationship to the fetish object.  For example:
	
	* Fetish Objects
	- Small clay statue made from memory- not likely
	- Favorite pair of pants- difficulty 3 to soak/resist
	- Painting of subject (posed for it)- difficulty 4 to soak/resist
	- Brother, sister, spouse- difficulty 5 to soak/resist
	- Mother, father, hammer that forged the object - difficulty 6 to soak
	- Identical twin, object made from same tree- difficulty 7 to soak
	- Some part of the target's mass- difficulty 8 to soak/resist
	
	Any damage that is inflicted upon the fetish object, of course, will
	not merely transfer across the sympathetic link but also actually harm
	the object.  Therefore, there is a limit to how much damage can be
	inflicted upon a subject from afar.  There are two such limiting
	factors:
	* The object- if the object is not very resilient, it cannot long
	serve as a fetish object.  It will fall apart.
	* The link- the closer the fetish object is to the target, the more
	damage it can potentially inflict.  The difficulty to soak is also the
	maximum amount of (unsoaked) damage that can be inflicted upon the
	target using that object.

Sympathetic Travel (Mental) [AL]
	Sympathetic Travel relies on the spiritual bonds between similar things
	to move the mutant from place to place.  There are many variations of
	this Power, but most involve solid or liquid substances.  Few Powers
	allow such a versatile and effortless mode of travel.  Roll Dexterity +
	Sympathetic Travel.

	Common Variations:
	* Digital- the mutant may digitize herself and travel along any
	appropriate digital communications channel.
	* Doorways- any door or archway within range can be used with this
	Power.
	* Mirror- the mutant can step into any reflecting surface of
	sufficient size , "phasing" into it, and step out of any other
	reflecting surface of the same within range. The diff depends on how
	the surface resembles a Mirror.
	* People- the mutant can touch any person and appear beside any blood
	relative of that person within range.
	* Plant- the mutant can step into a plant of any genus and size,
	"phasing" into it, and step out of any other plant of the same genus
	within range.
	* Psychic Channel- the mutant may transport himself along any sort of
	psychic channel between himself and another person or place (be it a 
	Psychic Link, Psionic Collective, Blood Bond, etc.)
	* Shadows- the mutant can step into any shadow of sufficient size,
	"phasing" into it, and step out of any other Shadow, of sufficient
	size, within range.
	* Stone- the mutant can step into any stone of sufficient size, "phasing"
	into it, and step out of any other stone of the same composition within
	range.
	* Water- the mutant can immerse himself in a body of water, and move
	instantly to any other part of that body of water within range, or any
	body of water which she has immersed herself in before, if it is 
	within range.

	¥ Up to 100 metres
	¥¥ Anywhere within line of sight, or one mile
	¥¥¥ Up to 100 miles away
	¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on the planet
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere in the solar system
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere in the galaxy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in the universe

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Apportation- requires the variations People or Psychic Channel.  The
	mutant may choose to bring another through the link rather than travel
	herself.
	¥¥¥ Peeping- rather than teleporting, the mutant can employ a variation
	of Clairvoyance, seeing out of any prospective destination within range.

Synthetic Merger (Mental) [AL]
	This Power can be nasty.  It allows a mutant to combine the effects of
	two other Powers that he has and use them at the same time.  This is
	restricted to Social and Mental Powers.  For example, Psychic Blast
	could be combined with Telepathic Interference to create a blast that 
	disrupted the target's ability to use telepathy (as if at the range of
	touch) while simultaneously inflicting the damage and effects that
	are associated with the Psychic Blast.  Not all Powers can interface
	in this way; STs may use their discretion.  There is no roll required
	with this Power.
	
	¥ Two Powers may be merged; they must both be from the same category.
	¥¥ Up to three Powers may be merged.
	¥¥¥ As many as four Powers may be merged; they can be from different
	categories.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to five Powers may be merged.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Any or all of the mutant's Powers may be merged.

Tactical Supremacy (Mental) [PN]
	Like Cyclops, Captain America, and Battalion, your character can see
	the world almost in terms of a chess board.  While the behaviour of the
	stock market or the opposite sex may still be impenetrable, combat is
	one thing that the mutant understands, and she knows how to communicate
	this insight to others.  In short, there can be no better leader.
	
	Opponents with multiple actions in one round (those who have Powers like
	Rage, Hyper Speed, Celerity, and the like) are more difficult to read;
	all rolls are at +2 difficulty.  This Power is also trumped (does not
	function) against opponents with Precognition, Combat Sense, Combat
	Telepathy, Possibility Forging, or X-Factoring.
	
	The mutant adds his Rank in Tactical Supremacy to his Wits + Tactics
	rolls, which can be made once per combat.  Battlefields for which the
	mutant has prepared make this roll difficulty 6.  Battles for which he 
	is unprepared increase the difficulty of this roll to 8.
	
	Group Bonuses: if the opposition is a trained group (such as a military
	squad or a team like Freedom Force), the bonuses apply against the entire
	team.  If they are merely skirmishers, the mutant must concentrate on a
	single opponent.  For example, Freedom Force (Mystique, Avalanche, Blob,
	Pyro, Crimson Commando, Super Sabre, and Stonewall) are a coherent group,
	trained to fight together.  The Sinister Six (including Electro, the
	Beetle, Doctor Octopus, the Shocker, the Vulture, and the Scorpion) are
	united only by their hatred of Spider-man, and neither like nor trust
	each other.  They are skirmishers only-- each man follows his own head
	and notions.
	
	Team Bonuses: if the mutant is fighting with a group that have trained to
	battle together (the X-Men are the best example of this, but the Avengers
	have also shown unit cohesion), the bonuses will also apply to his team
	members.  The ST rules on whether or not a group constitutes a team, and
	some characters (if new, or contrary) may be excluded until their condition
	changes.
	
	¥¥¥ At the beginning of combat, the mutant makes his Wits + Tactics
	roll, as appropriate.  If successful, he sees the basic shape of the
	situation (vis a vis land, comportment, aisles of movement, and so on)
	and can anticipate both the enemy's likely movements and possible
	weaknesses (in terms of position).  He is at -2 difficulty to dodge any
	one attack a round. In addition, his successes on the initial roll
	represent bonus dice which he may assign to any single combat-related
	dice pool (be it Dexterity, Strength, Stamina, Wits, Intelligence, or
	Perception- related).  Thus, if he gets four successes at the start of
	the combat, he might spend one of his dice in the first round to boost
	his initiative, then two more in the third round on a dodge roll, and
	finally the fourth on a soak roll in the sixth round.  He may also bark
	a command (costing one of these dice) to offer a teammate a -1
	difficulty to dodge or to make an attack on the affected enemy or
	enemies.  This is a free action.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant may also make one free dodge roll per round or make an
	attack of opportunity without splitting his dice pool-- any enemy within
	reach that either makes an attack roll against someone else, or fails an
	attack roll against the mutant, may be designated as a target for such
	an attack.  All allies that act after him in a round may benefit from his
	orders, receiving a -1 difficulty to dodge any one attack, or one extra
	die to take aggressive action.  The tactician himself can apply his -2
	difficulty bonus to any and all dodge or evasion attempts he attempts 
	against his opponent(s) in a round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's difficulty bonus applies to his attack rolls as well
	as his defensive maneuvers (minimum difficulty of 3).  All allies who
	act after their leader in a round may make one free dodge roll, and
	each receive bonus dice equal to the original Wits + Tactics roll, just
	as the leader does.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Last call- the player always declares her action for the round
	last, regardless of her initiative roll.
	¥¥¥¥ Pincer- the mutant is expert at timing and coordinating attacks,
	and can always make simultaneous attacks with a teammate on one target.
	That target can only dodge one attack, even if he has multiple action
	capability.  Pincer attacks are attacks of opportunity.
	¥¥¥¥ Steady hand- the player may reroll any failed attack or dodge roll
	with the expenditure of a point of Power Charge or Willpower.  She may
	reroll any number of times, so long as there are points to be spent.
	
Tactile Telekinesis (Mental) [AL and/or AH]
	Like Superboy of the DC line of comics, a mutant with this Power has a
	very special form of TK.  This form works quite differently than the
	standard form, but is also powerful in its way.  So long as the character
	is awake and on his guard, TTK is active; it requires very little in
	the way of concentration for the less complicated tasks.  In essence,
	the mutant has to be touching something in order to affect it with TTK.
	This means that he cannot hold someone still unless he is touching that
	person!  Most uses of Tactile Telekinesis require an Intelligence + TTK
	roll; the difficulties vary.
	
	¥ Lift/move 50 pounds
	¥¥ Lift/move 300 pounds
	¥¥¥ Lift/move 1000 lbs
	¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 5 tons
	¥¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 30 tons

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Lift/move 3 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Lift/move 10 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Lift/move 30 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 100 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 1 megaton

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Flight- no problem!
	¥¥ Get a Grip- acts as the equivalent Rank of Adhesion (requires some
	concentration).
	¥¥¥ Armour up- the mutant can add one soak die per success against all
	kinetic attacks (including energy attacks that rely on kinetic energy,
	such as cold, heat, plasma, etc. but not nullfire, nexus, radiation)
	on an Intelligence + TTK roll (diff 6).

Tap the Expanse* (Mental) [AH]
	This is a strange and rarely encountered power.  Wielders of this
	ability are able to tap a vast wellspring of potential termed the
	Expanse by those who know of it.  The Expanse is a not-place.  It is a
	repository of Earth's collective unconscious, composed of the essence
	of hallucinations, fantasies, daydreams and the like.  If it has been
	imagined, then it lies somewhere in this great repository of ideas.  A
	mutant with this power is able to tap her mind directly into this
	collective unconsciousness and bring its imaginings into reality.  In
	essence she is creating something from nothing.

	In order to use this power the mutant must first reach out and tap
	into the flow that makes up the Expanse, requiring a Perception + Tap
	the Expanse roll (diff. 7).  Success allows the mutant to begin to
	sift through the vast storehouse, and search for her desired result.
	This may take several rounds. Failure simply means the mutant failed
	to tap into the flow.  A botch however results in the mutant tapping
	into the flow too strongly, overwhelming her and preventing her from
	seeking out specifics, this requires a Willpower roll (diff 9 - the
	mutant's Wits) in order to break free before the power can be used
	again.  Once she has successfully tapped into the Expanse it requires
	a Wits + Alertness roll (diff set by ST depending on the specific
	imagining wanted, the more complex the sought after image, the rarer
	and harder it is to find).  A success on this results in the desired
	presence being located, while failure merely means the search needs to
	be continued.  A botch causes the exact same situation as in the roll
	to tap into the flow, and means that the entire process must begin all
	over again.  After the desired object/fantasy etc has been found the
	mutant can begin to create it for real.  This uses a Manipulation +
	Tap the Expanse roll (diff equals complexity of the object, it's
	easier to make sure you get a Royal Flush at poker than to create a
	gun, and easier to create a gun than a person).  The length of time it
	takes for the object to materialize is also dependent on the
	complexity of the object.  Small objects like a pack of cigarettes, a
	glass of water etc. appear with no announcement, making it easy to
	hide the sudden arrival of these things.  Objects any larger than this
	though announce themselves by first forming a nebulous cloud of
	glowing ether that slowly begins to take on the shape of the object
	before finally appearing.  It should be noted that these objects need
	space to manifest and can not be materialized inside anything or
	anyone.  And if they are disturbed before the ether has begun to take
	on a semblance of solidity the effect is disrupted and the mutant must
	begin her work all over again.

	Especially large objects (larger than a full-sized sedan) are a bit
	more problematic.  For every hundred cubic feet by which the object
	exceeds that size, the mutant must invest an additional point of
	Power Charge to bring it into being.

	Of course this power is not without its own problems as its wielder
	will soon come to find out.  For starters a botch on the roll to
	actually create an object tends to still bring the object into being,
	but in a fashion that is extremely detrimental and hazardous to the
	mutant herself.  In addition if the mutant ever botches more rolls to
	tap into the Expanse in 24 hours than her total in Willpower she will
	find herself overwhelmed by the images and begin to lose her grip on
	reality and slip into insanity.  Also it is easier to transmute
	existing nonliving and nonsentient objects than it is to create them
	from whole cloth, reducing the difficulty by 1.  So it is much easier
	to change that useless hand of cards into a Royal Flush or that toy
	sword into a real one.  Of course with the cards that means you may
	wind up with exact duplicates of cards held by other individuals.

	Note that as these objects are taken from the collective unconscious,
	their design and attributes are not necessarily what the mutant
	imagines them to be.  If the mutant does not get five successes on his
	roll to tap into the flow, then the object may have a quality or two
	that the mutant is unaware of (for instance, a car that he pulls out
	of the expanse may run on swimming pool water, rather than on
	gasoline).  This is entirely at the ST's discretion.  If the
	attributes of the creation are too unusual, then it will tend to be
	short-lived rather than permanent (anywhere from a day per success to
	a round per success).

	If the mutant is attempting to create an object that is fantastic (for
	instance, a space vessel of some kind, or a ray gun), there may be
	some difficulty.  Finding such objects in the expanse is easy, even
	trivial, but making reality accept them is quite another matter.  Just
	as mages must suffer paradox when their own magick is too fantastic, a
	mutant who pulls out a woolly mammoth is going to run into some
	problems.  Such objects, based so heavily on ephemera and so lightly
	on reality, tend to "leak" psychic energy, which is a very visible
	effect and causes psychic static in the area (+2 to all maneuvers by
	psi-sensitives, including the character with this power).  They don't
	last very long before disintegrating back into the ether, either (one
	round/success) and require a substantial investiture of substance in
	order to get them to work as advertised.  To get a mammoth to act like
	an animal would require the expenditure of one Willpower point per
	round (not too hard), but to get a space vessel to function as such
	would require the expenditure of one point of Permanent Willpower per
	round (ultimately very costly).  In between, a laser gun would
	probably cost three Willpower per round.  It is not that these objects
	do not or cannot exist somewhere, but rather that they are such hazy
	concepts in the collective unconscious (it is unlikely that their
	imaginers have given much thought to how they work).

	Simple objects (like the cards or sword described above) are
	essentially permanent, with the exception that an existing object that
	has been 're-forged' by this Power will revert to its old form in one
	hour/ success.  Objects with fantastic attributes (like a sword that
	never needs sharpening or can cut through steel) are never permanent,
	and will fade all the more quickly for their unusual natures.  Even if
	they are not unnatural enough to leak, they will never last more than
	a day.  Usually, their lifespans are measured in hours or even
	minutes.  In any case, some objects (like a sword that kills at a
	touch, or that can cleave through adamantium) are too fantastic to
	exist even for an instant; they would require more "food" in the form
	of Willpower and Power Charge than any mutant could supply.

	The mutant will also attract various spirits of the dead towards her
	person, as they to are a part of the world's collective unconscious
	and they feel her ability to affect reality. Naturally a good many of
	them will be seeking to have the mutant recreate them as they were in
	life.  The mutant herself has no knowledge of these spirits, unless
	she is the possessor of some means to see/speak/interact with these
	spirits.  This does not mean that some of these spirits do not posses
	ways to affect the mutant.

	This power can also not be used to totally alter the course of
	reality. The past can not be altered, nor can the future.  In addition
	attempts to totally rewrite the world will be met with sudden and
	vicious smackdown of the cosmic type (usually resulting in loss of
	substantial amounts of Power Charge and Health, the amounts to be
	determined by the seriousness of the offense).  Attempts to refigure
	the sun, for instance, are doomed to painful failure.  People resist
	refiguring in the same way.

	There are some things that even the most powerful mutant shouldn't
	stick her nose in.  So while a dead person could be brought back with
	this power (within the limits about to be mentioned) history couldn't
	be altered so that the subject had never died.  Objects and events
	created with this power are real, and frequently quite permanent,
	however people and beings created are not alive so to speak.  This
	Power can merely provide a body that will be re-animated by the spirit
	of the dear departed, the spirit is unfortunately merely inhabiting a
	shell.  If it is a living body, it will slowly rot (as it is not truly
	alive).  To anyone with the ability to tell they will smell unnatural,
	and as if they had no souls (making them immune to soul-affecting
	powers and abilities, but if they die, that's it; they cease to exist,
	such is the price paid.  This applies even if it's a dead person
	remade into flesh).  Any living creature that is 'permanent' will be
	animated in this way (a squirrel that the mutant creates will be a
	flesh shell animated by a spirit.  That shell will slowly rot and
	eventually the spirit will be extinguished).

	These creations can not be endowed with powers, disciplines or Mage
	spheres etc. (for obvious reasons).

	All uses of this power require the expenditure of a point of Power
	Charge while the creation of a living, or otherwise sentient being
	requires the expenditure of two Power Charge and one Temporary
	Willpower point.

	Special Flaw: I See Dead People (2-pt. Flaw); The mutant finds that
	she can see the spirits of the dead, especially those attracted by
	her power.  She can not speak with these spirits, or even begin to
	understand what they want, she just sees them.  And she sees them
	everywhere, all the time. Obviously this would start to get to anybody
	after a while.

	¥¥¥¥ The mutant has the ability to tap her mind into the flow that
	creates the Expanse and bring the imaginings found there into the
	world.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Straight Road- after many taps for the same object, the mutant
	gains the ability to tap for it instantly; time passes only for the
	materialization of the object.  This Stunt must be purchased once
	for each such object.  The ST determines whether or not a particular
	object is eligible.  Sentient or living beings are never eligible.

Techno-Organic Body Parts (Physical) [PN]
	This Power allows a mutant to have technological body parts that are
	real, functioning components of his physiology.  Cable has a T/O arm,
	while the Archangel had T/O wings.  These body parts are usually
	metallic, and can heal just like normal body parts.  Any body part that
	you've got can be made a T-O part- which means that Archangel first had
	to purchase the Power: Wings before he got this Power to make them
	metallic.  Archangel's Wings were actually a combination of the Powers:
	Wings, T/O Body Parts (Wings), Secretions (Paralytic), and Body
	Weaponry (Projectile).  These parts cannot be affected by
	Biomanipulation powers.  No roll is required. 
	
	Note that technological equipment can be interfaced to techno-organic
	body parts and operated using the mutant's nervous system, as of the
	Power: Assimilation, but an operation akin to surgery is required to
	interface and deinterface such equipment.  See the Repair Only flaw for
	the minimum qualifications for such surgery.

	Special Flaw: Repair Only (4-point Flaw): The mutant's T/O parts will
	not heal in the normal way, and must be repaired by a qualified
	technician.  Cybernetic surgeons don't exactly grow on trees, either.
	In order to be fully qualified, the technician must have Repair 5, Fine
	Control 4, Computer 4, Technology 5, Cybernetic Technology at a Rank
	equal to the Rank of the part needing service, and Medicine 4.  This is
	obviously a tall order.  Someone with Repair 5 and Fine Control 4 may
	successfully operate if she has advisors with the other abilities. Some
	of these requirements can be bypassed by people with appropriate Powers
	(Biomanipulation, Technomorphing, Technological Telepathy, etc.)
	
	Special Flaw: Techno-Organic Virus (6-point Flaw): This is a big, big
	handicap.  The reason why you have T/O body parts is because a virus is
	slowly transforming you into an organic machine.  If you have powerful
	TK, you may be able to hold it off by sacrificing 3 Power Ranks to do so;
	thus, while you are fighting your virus, your TK ¥¥¥¥ is effectively a
	TK ¥.  Energy Control (Magnetism) can achieve the same effect at the same
	price.  If you have no means of fighting off the virus, your character's
	body will slowly be consumed and you will die within one month.  Cable
	has this Flaw.

	¥ A small part, such as an eye or hand, can be made Techno-Organic. 
	This part, if it has a Strength rating, effectively has a bonus of two
	dots to Strength.  Attacks specifically targeting this area are less
	effective, and the mutant gets a 2-dice bonus to soak such attacks.
	¥¥ A larger part, such as a lower leg or forearm, can be made T/O.  If
	appropriate, the mutant can parry weapons attacks using his Brawl score
	when this part is employed to do so.  Specifically targeted attacks
	against this area must overcome the mutant's 3-dice bonus to soak.
	¥¥¥ An entire arm or leg, part of the torso, etc. can be made T/O.  A
	specific 4-die bonus to soak.  A bonus of 3 dots to the part's Strength.
	¥¥¥¥ Both arms or legs, wings, etc.  A specific 5-dice bonus to soak.
	Your brain can be made T/O at this level, which will have the effect of
	increasing the difficulty of any telepathic or mind-affecting attack on
	your character by 4.  If this increases the difficulty of the attack 
	beyond 10, then the character is immune to that attack.  On the other
	hand, the character is susceptible to Technological Telepathy.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The entire body south of the neck, if desired.  A bonus of 4 dots
	to the part's Strength, and a specific 6-dice bonus to soak.  Most
	attacks, therefore, would have to puncture the T/O at this rank.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant is a full-conversion borg.  Only her brain is still
	organic, if that is desired.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ T/O Endopathy- the mutant can 'speak' to his Techno-organic Parts
	as per the Power: Endopathy above.

Technological Telepathy (Mental) [AH]
	A very unusual variant of Telepathy, which was only possessed by the
	Acolyte Milan.  This is the ability to communicate with machines of
	various sorts.  A certain level of complexity is usually required for
	the mutant to be able to get his point across; the greater the TPath,
	the more simple the machines that he can communicate with.  Machines
	can be compelled or asked to perform (or misperform) their functions
	or anything else they are capable of; you can't ask a food processor
	to leap off of a counter, for instance (it can't move).  A car could
	be asked to start itself and drive down the block, though.  Note that
	the understanding of machines is quite limited (a car does not know
	where Los Angeles is, though it may know how to get 'home', for
	instance) so step-by-step instructions are often required.  In all other
	respects, this power is like Telepathy; only the target is different.
	Robots, Phalanx, and people with T/O parts should be careful...
	The basic roll is Perception + Telepathy to detect, Manipulation + 
	Telepathy to actively manipulate, Intelligence + Telepathy to attack, 
	or Charisma + Telepathy to convince.

	¥ Detect sentient machines, data transfer, shield mind.  Computers, robots,
	and Phalanx-like aliens may be affected.
	¥¥ Detect telepaths and other unusual minds (like insane folks, or mages)
	Read surface data.  Cars, food processors- anything with a mini computer
	in it (no matter how feeble).  T/O body parts, as well.
	¥¥¥ Deliver imperatives (Manipulation + Telepathy, Willpower to resist)-
	requires a separate roll for each command, Read memories.  Televisions,
	radios, alarm clocks, etc.
	¥¥¥¥ Alter perceptions, implant memories, cause derangement, dominate.
	Electronic doors & can openers, light switches- anything with electrical
	current.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral form, prevent power use, mental blocks, mental assault
	(can actually cause physical damage!)  You are communicating with the
	spirit of the object- anything man-made and inorganic can be made to
	listen to you.

	Sample Power Stunts
	¥ Detect machines & machine spirits (Per + Awareness)
	¥¥ Multitasking- you can perform a physical action as well as a mental
	one at +2 difficulty to each.  Higher than ten difficulty means that
	it is impossible to perform that action.
	¥¥ ESP- you can buy the power Mega-Perception (ESP) with Experience
	points, even if you did not start with it.
	¥¥¥ Subtle implant- you can bury a command or file into the target
	machine's memory or consciousness and make it difficult for others to
	detect (Man + Subterfuge, +1 difficulty to detect per success)
	¥¥¥ Understand language- use the knowledge from a computer to
	program in a language that you don't know.
	¥¥¥ Virus- the mutant may create a digital virus; the base difficulty
	for this is four, for an annoying virus that is easy to detect and
	remove.  Increases in virulence, transparency, and resistance to
	removal all contribute to an increase in difficulty.  Cross-platform
	viruses have a base diff of 7.
	¥¥¥¥ Invisibility- you don't notice me!  Cameras will not pick up the
	mutant's image; tape recorders will not record his voice.
	¥¥¥¥ Mental Blocks- you can erect a block (roll Telepathy, count the
	successes) in a target machine's command processes to keep it from
	performing a certain action.  If the target attempts to perform the
	action anyway, it requires as many successes on a Willpower check as
	you got successes to erect the block.  Destroying the block in this way
	takes an action.  Only sentient targets may attempt this.  Programmers
	may attempt to remove a block in the normal way; finding it will take
	one or more Intelligence + Computer rolls (diff 7-9, Storyteller's
	discretion), requiring a number of accumulated successes equal to the
	mutant's Rank in this Power plus his successes in placing the block
	(minimum 5).
	¥¥¥¥ Astral travel- surf the Astral Plane.  Weird and wonderful.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral possession- better than dominate.  You can embody like
	a wraith and take over a machine.  Requires Astral travel.  Once inside
	the host, a battle of wills takes place- each round, the two contest
	each other in a Willpower check (diff 4).  Since machines usually do
	not have Willpower, this is typically a one-sided contest; otherwise,
	the victor in the Willpower check drains a point of Temporary Willpower
	from the loser, and the struggle begins anew until there is no contest.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Astral survival- live through the destruction of your body!
	Good luck getting another one, though...  Requires Astral travel.

Technological Vampirism (Physical) [PL]
	Like Cybersix, the mutant must ingest an artificial substance to
	survive. This does not have to be a fluid (Cybersix, for instance,
	must drain the fluids of other cyborgs of her type); it can even be a
	solid.  The only requirement is that the substance be artificial (as
	in man-made, or perhaps alien-made).  The mutant must, at the very
	least, make physical contact with the device in order to drain it,
	which is a Strength + Technological Vampirism roll (diff 6).  In some
	cases, a roll to hit in a combat situation (or even a grapple) may be
	required before this Power can be used.
	
	If the mutant does not ingest one 'point' of the substance per day,
	she will lose a Health Level.  The mutant can always absorb these
	materials for Health, in addition to other uses she might put them
	to (see below).  The complexity of the substance will govern how 
	many 'points' it is worth:
	
	Sophisticated alien tech (X-Men danger room, alien computer)- three
	points or more per 100 grams
	
	High technology (Richards, Stark, or Forge-class stuff)- two points
	per 100 grams
	
	State-of-the-art computers and the like- one point per 100 grams
	
	Dedicated computers, complex circuitry, etc- one point per kilo.
	
	Transistor radios, cars, blenders, etc- two kilograms per point
	
	Plastics and other artificial substances- five kilos per point
	
	Special Flaw: One Victim (1-3 pts.)- like Cybersix, the mutant
	requires a certain (very specific) substance in order to live.  The
	value of the flaw depends on the rarity and complexity of the
	substance.  A low-rarity, high-complexity item would be worth one,
	while a high-rarity, low complexity item would be worth three.

	Common Variations:
	* Strength- each point can be turned into a point of Strength for the
	scene.
	* Armour- each point can be turned into a point of Body Armour (up to
	the mutant's Actual Power Level can be converted).
	* Realization- the mutant will intuitively understand the devices he
	absorbs for up to one day per point of Intelligence; this may allow
	him to duplicate these devices later.
	* Charge- the mutant regains one point of Power Charge per point.
	
	¥¥¥ The mutant is a technological vampire.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Store- the mutant can store a number of spare 'points' up to her 
	Power Potential.
	
Technomorphing (Mental) [AL]
	Wielding this Power, a mutant can reconfigure an electrical and/or
	mechanical device.  While no mass is usually added or lost, the device
	can change its shape without losing its function (within reason).
	This is usually a difficulty 5 action on a Manipulation + Technomorphing
	roll.  More interestingly, a device can be reshaped, changing its
	function.  This is an Intelligence + Technomorphing roll, the difficulty
	being directly related to how much the device has been changed.  A 
	neural disrupter being changed into an electrical power generator would
	only be difficulty 6, while changing a personal computer into a gun
	would be difficulty 9.  Naturally, the character must have the knowledge
	to build a device in the first place (high levels of Science and Tech
	are good; Hyper-Invention is better).  Of course, two small devices
	could be changed into one larger one, and the reverse is also true.
	Scalphunter made use of this Power during the Morlock Massacre.
	
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can reconfigure devices as described above.  This
	requires little in the way of physical contact and input, and is
	usually an operation of five minutes or less.  No tools are required.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Breakdown- the mutant may disassemble any device that he has built
	as a free action, in one round.

Telekinesis (Mental) [AH]
	Telekinesis is the ability to generate molecular movement with your mind.
	This can be expressed on the microscopic level or the macroscopic level.
	Microscopically, telekinesis can be used to generate heat, cause small
	fires, and at extremely high levels of ability, cause chemical changes.
	Macroscopically, it is used to move objects or hold them in place.  The
	macroscopic ability is much the more common of the two.  Nate Grey and
	Phoenix have this power.

	¥ Lift/move 50 pounds
	¥¥ Lift/move 300 pounds
	¥¥¥ Lift/move 1000 lbs
	¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 5 tons
	¥¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 30 tons

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Lift/move 3 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Lift/move 10 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Lift/move 30 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 100 kilotons
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Lift/move 1 megaton

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Amplify Blow- the mutant adds one die per Rank of Telekinesis to
	her Brawl or Melee damage dice pools.
	¥ Absorb blow- the mutant can add one soak die per Rank of TK
	from one attack as an action.  Stamina + TK.
	¥¥ Invisible Touch (inflict damage directly. Perception + Directed
	Blast, 2 dice of damage/level).
	¥¥ Fine Control- allows the mutant to use her TK as a dice pool
	for attacking with a weapon, picking locks, etc.  Dex + TK.
	¥¥ Flight at 20 mph per success on a Strength + TK.
	¥¥¥ Forcefield- the mutant can add one soak die per success,
	whether or not she is aware that the attack is coming.  Requires
	light concentration.  Intelligence + TK.
	¥¥¥ Healing- the mutant, if he has sufficient Medicine, can patch
	together his body (or the bodies of others).  Heals one Health Level of
	physical bashing damage per success.  Cuts and burns and other nasty
	bits require the Microscopic TK Stunt.  Requires the Fine Control stunt
	in any case.  Intelligence + TK.
	¥¥¥ Telekinetic Radar- the mutant can send out light force 'blips'
	which bounce off of objects and return, giving her an idea of what
	solid objects are in the room.  The Fine Control power stunt is
	required if she wants to detect stuff like curtains.  If there are
	a bunch of objects or a complicated landscape, the data returning
	from the Radar may be more than the mutant's mind can process.
	Wits + TK (diff varies) to avoid sensory overload.
	¥¥¥¥ Inertial Dampening (You too can make 90¡ turns at 200 km/h!)
	Roll Dex + TK.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Microscopic telekinesis- this power stunt requires that the
	mutant take the Fine Control Power Stunt.  The mutant can start
	suggesting that microscopic particles do what he tells them to.
	Intelligence + TK; the standard difficulty is 8.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Electrokinesis- purchase the Electrokinesis Power with Experience
	points, even if you didn't start the game with this Power. Requires
	the Power Stunt: Microscopic TK.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Object Disintegration- purchase the Power: Object Disintegration
	with Experience points, even if you didn't start the game with this
	Power. Requires the Power Stunt: Microscopic TK.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Pyrokinesis- purchase the Pyrokinesis Power with Experience
	points, even if you didn't start the game with this Power.  Requires
	the Power Stunt: Microscopic TK.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Chemical Changes- requires the Stunt: Microscopic TK.  The
	mutant can actually cause chemical reactions to occur by manually
	'bumping' the atoms together.  Easy reactions are only difficulty 7;
	more improbable ones (creating aluminum oxide, for instance) may have a
	difficulty as high as 10.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Cryokinesis- purchase the Cryokinesis Power with Experience
	points, even if you didn't start the game with this Power. Requires
	the Power Stunt: Microscopic TK.

Telekinetic Shadow (Mental) [AN]
	A mutant with this Power is absolutely indetectible (and untouchable)
	by Telekinesis.  Though he or she is perfectly solid, the opposing psi's
	mind cannot 'feel' him, and therefore cannot act upon him with TK.  Note
	that this is not the same as Telepathic Indetectibility- the mutant may
	still be discovered by Telepathy (he still broadcasts thoughts).  He can
	also be struck by objects thrown or moved with Telekinesis.  He just
	can't be affected by it directly.  If the mutant himself has TK, he will
	not be able to use it on himself- no flight, for instance.  No roll
	is required.
	
	¥¥ The mutant is immune to the effects of Telekinesis.  Of course, a
	telekinetic can still whip rocks at him.  Pyrokinesis, Electrokinesis,
	and Cryokinesis also can't be used to affect him directly.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Clench- the mutant may 'grab on' to a telekinetic attack on him, like
	the end of a whip, and use the amount of force exerted on him against the
	originator of the effect.  Only gross effects are possible (a push or
	pull, for instance).

Telepathic Enhancement (Mental) [AL]
	By joining with another spirit (be it human, animal, whatever), the mutant
	who has this Power can enhance the Intelligence and Knowledges of that
	spirit to levels similar to his own.  On its own, this Power allows for
	no communication between subjects; merely enhancement to other humans.
	It can be combined with other Telepathic Powers, however (including
	Animal Telepathy, Plant Control, and Technological Telepathy) for
	various interesting effects.  A computer can temporarily be given
	sentience with Technological Telepathy and this Power, for instance.
	The mutant spends a Willpower point to activate this Power.
	
	¥ Intelligence can be increased to a level one less than the telepath's-
	to a maximum Rank of three.  If the being was not sentient, then the
	Intelligence is taken to the Rank of this Power, at best.  No improvement
	to knowledges.  The enhancement lasts as long as the mutant concentrates.
	¥¥ Intelligence can be increased to a max of four or one less than the
	TPath's- whichever is less.  Knowledges can be improved by one Rank, 
	unless they were Rank zero- to the maximum of the TPath's Rank in that 
	knowledge.  The enhancement lasts as long as the mutant concentrates.
	¥¥¥ Intelligence can be increased to a max of five or on par with the
	TPath's- whichever is less.  Knowledges can be improved by two Ranks, or
	taken to Rank one- to the max of the TPath's Rank in that knowledge.  The
	enhancement lasts for one scene.
	¥¥¥¥ Intelligence can be increased to a max of five or on par with the
	TPath's- whichever is less.  Knowledges can be improved by three Ranks,
	to the max of the TPath's Rank in that knowledge.  The enhancement lasts
	for one day.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Intelligence can be increased to the level of the Tpath's- 
	whatever that may be.  Knowledges can be improved to the same Rank as 
	the Tpath's knowledges.  The enhancement lasts for one week.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Messages- the mutant may leave a short message (merely verbal or
	'visual') for psi-sensitives by imprinting it on a person, place, or
	thing.  These messages last for the regular duration of the mutant's
	power, and can be triggered by any psi-sensitive.
	¥¥¥¥ Booby Traps- the mutant may 'imprint' nasty memories or brutal
	scenes on a particular person, animal, or object that are not detectable
	by the subject.  The next psi-sensitive to scan the object, however, is
	going to get an unpleasant surprise.  For every point of Willpower the
	mutant spends on the trap, it will inflict one Health Level of bashing
	damage and cause painful headaches (amounting to a -1 dice penalty).

Telepathic Indetectibility (Mental) [AN]
	This is not the ability to make yourself invisible by clouding minds 
	like the Shadow; rather, this Power makes it hard for Telepaths to be 
	able to find you at all.  When a Telepath attempts to attack you, or 
	even detect you, this Power subtracts two dice per Rank from his pool.  
	Sabretooth got this Power after Wolvie popped a claw through his brain.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Spirit soak- because the mutant's 'footprint' on the Astral Plane
	(Penumbra, etc.) is so light, he receives one auto-soak per Rank against
	such Powers as Spirit Weaponry and Psychic Bolt.  The Charms, Gifts,
	and Bunks of spirit creatures are at +3 difficulty to affect him.
	¥¥¥ Under the radar- the mutant resists detection by such Powers as
	Danger Sense, Awareness, and even mental or social versions of Mutant
	Detection, and is completely impervious to any attempts to locate him
	with these Powers.

Telepathic Interference (Mental) [AN]
	This Power creates 'psychic static' which makes it difficult for
	telepaths and other mind-readers to concentrate or enter the Astral
	Plane.  For every Rank in this Power, the difficulty to perform any
	feat of Telepathy is increased by one.  This effect is semi-voluntary,
	and does not require concentration or even consciousness on the part
	of the mutant.  Roll Charisma + TP Interference (diff 5) to activate
	this Power (and the same to shut it off).
	
	¥ +1 difficulty to all Telepathy and Empathy rolls, range of touch.
	¥¥ +2 difficulty to Telepathy and Empathy at a range of touch,
	+1 diffs at a range of 5 feet.
	¥¥¥ + 3 difficulty at touch, +2 diffs at 5 feet, +1 diffs at 20 feet.
	¥¥¥¥ + 4 difficulty at touch, +3 at 5 feet, +2 at 20 feet, +1 diffs
	at 100 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ + 5 difficulty at a touch, +4 at 5 feet, +3 at 20 feet, +2 at
	100 feet, +1 at a mile.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ + 5 difficulty and one automatic 'one' at a touch, +5 at 5
	feet, 4 at 20 feet, +3 at 100 feet, +2 at a mile, +1 at two miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ +5 difficulty and two auto-ones at a touch, +5 and one auto-
	one at 5 feet, +5 at 20 feet, +4 at 100 feet, +3 at a mile, +2 at
	two miles, +1 at five miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ +5 and three auto-ones at a touch, +5 and 2 at 5 feet, +5
	and one at 20 feet, +5 at 100 feet, +4 at a mile, +3 at two miles,
	+2 at five miles, +1 at ten miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ +5 and four auto-ones at a touch, +5 and 3 at 5 feet, +5
	and two at 20 feet, +5 and one at 100 feet, +5 at a mile, +4 at two
	miles, +3 at five miles, +2 at ten miles, +1 at twenty-five miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ +5 and five auto-ones at a touch, +5 and four at 5 feet,
	+5 and three at 20 feet, +5 and two at 100 feet, +5 and one at a 
	mile, +5 at two miles, +4 at five miles, +3 at ten miles, +2 at
	twenty-five miles, +1 at fifty miles.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Harmonize Wave Patterns- the mutant may alter the 'texture' of
	the static at will, excluding particular telepaths from the effect
	or singling one or more out for such stunts as Painful Static.
	This requires some dice-pool splitting.
	¥¥¥ Painful Static- By concentrating, the mutant can make the static
	more noxious to telepaths, actually halving the dice pools of any
	psi-sensitives who are not properly shielded.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Collapse Wave- requires the Stunt: Harmonize Wave Patterns.  The
	mutant may single out a particular telepathic transmission, and
	present it with perfect interference, essentially collapsing the wave.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Reinforce Wave- requires the Stunt: Harmonize Wave Patterns. 
	The mutant may single out a particular telepathic wave and strengthen
	it without distortion, increasing the range and strength of the
	transmission (double the range of the transmission and increase the
	difficulty to resist by one for every Rank that the mutant has in this
	Power).

Telepathic Invisibility (Mental) [AH]
	You waited for it... THIS is the power to make yourself invisible by
	clouding minds like the Shadow.  It isn't true invisibility, but rather
	it makes people reluctant to notice, remember, or recognize you.  In
	a way, it is more thorough (since it defeats all of the senses), but
	it is easily resisted through the benefit of psychic defenses.
	
	¥¥¥ Contested Willpower check.  Difficulty is the opponent's Perception
	+ Telepathy or Psychic Defense.  The opponent's difficulty is the
	mutant's Willpower + 2 (max 10).  If the mutant succeeds, he isn't
	noticed, recognized, or remembered (his option).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Arcane- purchase the Background: Arcane with Experience points
	at a cost of two points per dot. (See Mage: the Ascension).  This is 
	a one-time only offer, so if you can only afford one point of Arcane, 
	then that's all you get.
	¥¥¥ Fear of the Shadow- you may cause an unpleasant frisson of fear
	in those who hear your voice, when you cloud their minds.  This will
	cause a +1 difficulty to all Dexterity and Wits dice pools for the
	scene unless they make a Willpower Check (diff of the mutant's Will+2)
	¥¥¥ Mental Hiccup- the mutant can converse with people, and they will
	forget the conversation if they fail a Willpower check.

Telepathy* (Mental) [AH]
	Telepathy is the ability to communicate using pure thought, without the
	mediation of the physical.  Brain to brain.  At the lowest levels, this
	is merely the ability to sense when someone is near, or talk to them
	mind- to-mind.  At the highest levels, mind/body dissociation and
	astral travel is possible.  Charles Xavier, Phoenix, and Mr. Sinister
	are all associated with powerful Telepathy.  The basic roll is
	Perception + Telepathy to detect, Manipulation + Telepathy to actively
	manipulate, Intelligence + Telepathy to attack, or Charisma + Telepathy
	to convince.  The target receives a Willpower Check (difficulty of the
	Telepath's Willpower) to resist, requiring a number of successes equal
	to the Telepath's Rank in this Power.  Iron Will offers one automatic
	success per Rank vs. TP, regardless of the difficulty.
	
	¥ Touch the mind of someone within line of sight.  This does not allow
	mind-reading or even conversation initially, but these abilities can
	be developed with Power Stunts.
	¥¥ Range of line-of-sight, or 100 meters without line of sight.
	¥¥¥ Range of one kilometre.
	¥¥¥¥ Range of ten kilometres.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Range of 100 kilometres.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Omnipathy (affect any (or every!) mind on Earth at a Rank
	one level)-- beyond the range of 100 kilometres, only Rank ¥ stunts
	may be used.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Rank two omnipathy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Rank three omnipathy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Rank four omnipathy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Rank five omnipathy
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Detect Sentient Beings- a Perception + Telepathy roll will allow
	the mutant to detect the presence of any minds in the immediate
	area. This is a difficulty 4 roll. This ability can be 'jammed' by
	other telepaths and by mutants with Telepathic Indetectibility.
	¥ Detect wraiths, spirits, and astral travelers-- all of which must
	be in the near-Astral, near-Umbra, etc.  Requires the Stunt: Detect
	Sentient Beings.
	¥ Mental Conversation- the mutant can speak, mind-to-mind, with
	another willing subject. Each projects his thoughts deliberately.
	Surface thoughts cannot be detected. The mutant can, if desired,
	merely project his thoughts at most unwilling targets with an
	Intelligence + Telepathy roll (diff 5).
	¥ Read Emotional Impressions- a Perception + Telepathy roll (diff 6)
	allows the mutant to read the emotions of others. It can be jammed
	normally, and is also resisted by mutants with Empathic Resistance
	or Projective Empathy.  Projective Empaths are also able to give a
	Telepath a false impression.
	¥ Shield Mind- This allows the telepath to close his mind to others.
	This jams most telepathic abilities on this list. The mutant's
	Willpower is the difficulty for any power to succeed, and each point
	of Iron Will that the mutant possesses represents one extra success
	that the invading telepath must get to succeed in breaking through
	the mutant's defenses.
	¥¥ Detect Defenses- A Perception + Telepathy roll (difficulty of the
	opposing mutant's Intelligence + Psychic Defense) will allow the
	telepath to determine that a mutant has psychic defenses. The same
	system applies to Psychic Invulnerability and the Mind Sphere, but
	not Telepathic Indetectibility.
	¥¥ Detect Telepath- A Perception + Telepathy roll (difficulty of the
	opposing mutant's Intelligence + Telepathy) will allow the mutant to
	determine whether or not the fellow in question is a Telepath. The
	same system applies to Telekinesis, Projective Empathy, and
	Pyrokinesis.
	¥¥ ESP- you can buy the power Mega-Perception (ESP) with Experience
	points, even if you did not start with it.
	¥¥ Read Surface Thoughts- a Perception + Telepathy roll (difficulty
	of the victim's Intelligence) allows the mutant to read a person's
	surface thoughts. If the victim is aware of the intrusion, he may
	actively resist using Willpower (difficulty 6, one success takes
	away one of the Telepath's successes). Psychic Defense dice are
	added to the difficulty automatically.
	¥¥ Multitasking- you can perform a physical action as well as a mental
	one at +2 difficulty to each.  Higher than ten difficulty means that
	it is impossible to perform that action.
	¥¥¥ Deliver Imperative- a Manipulation + Telepathy roll (difficulty
	of the victim's Willpower) allows the telepath to implant a direct
	order, such as 'walk to the car' or 'shoot Banshee'. The victim will
	be fully aware of this tampering. Each order requires a separate
	check. The number of successes required depends on the repulsiveness
	of the act- to force Wolverine to kiss Jean Grey would require only
	one success, while to force him to attack her would require five
	successes. Each point of Psychic Defense or Telepathy is another
	success required by the telepath to deliver the imperative. The
	victim may also actively resist using Iron Will (difficulty of the
	telepath's Rank in Telepathy).  Requires all Rank ¥ stunts.
	¥¥¥ Induce Emotional State- the telepath may induce an emotion such
	as joy, terror, sorrow, or boredom in a victim with a Charisma +
	Telepathy roll (difficulty of the victim's Wits). If the victim has
	Psychic Defenses or Empathic Resistance, add these dice to the
	difficulty. This is usually fairly easy to detect, and may be
	actively resisted using Willpower (diff 6).  Requires the stunt:
	Read Emotional Impressions.
	¥¥¥ Mindscape- the telepath may enter an idealized landscape formed
	from the victim's subconscious mind on a Charisma + Telepathy roll
	(difficulty of the victim's Willpower) there to gain some insight by
	reading symbolism. Careful, though... if the victim is aware of your
	presence, he can control the surroundings like a dream...  Requires
	all Rank ¥ stunts.
	¥¥¥ Read Memories- a Perception + Telepathy roll (difficulty of the
	victim's Willpower + Psychic Defense) allows the mutant to look at a
	particular memory. This may be actively resisted by the victim if he
	is aware of the intrusion (Willpower, diff 6).  Requires the stunt:
	Read Surface Thoughts.
	¥¥¥ Subtle implant- you can make it seem (Manipulation + Subterfuge) as
	though an imperative that you implant actually originated in the 
	target's mind.  Difficulty of the victim's Int + Subterfuge.  Requires
	the Stunts: Read Memories and Deliver Imperative.
	¥¥¥ Understand language- use the knowledge from someone else's head to
	carry on a conversation in a language that you don't know!  Perception
	+ Telepathy, difficulty of the target's Wits + Linguistics.  Requires
	the Stunt: Read Memories.
	¥¥¥¥ Invisibility- you don't notice me!  The difficulty is the target's
	Perception + Intuition or Perception + Awareness.
	¥¥¥¥ Alter Senses- you may purchase the Power: Alter Senses with
	Experience.  Requires the Stunt: Subtle Implant.
	¥¥¥¥ Cause Derangement- the mutant can temporarily interfere with
	the victim's ability to think logically (Intelligence + Telepathy,
	difficulty of the victim's Intelligence) on a given matter- fooling
	her into thinking that her friends are strangers, or that the number
	6 does not exist, or that the arrival of a stranger means that she
	will receive a present. Iron Will, Psychic Defense, and other Powers
	interfere with this ability normally.  Requires the Stunt: Subtle
	Implant.
	¥¥¥¥ Dominate- this operates exactly like Deliver Imperative, but
	requires only one roll to establish the telepath's hegemony, which
	lasts until the victim successfully resists it.  Requires the
	Stunt: Deliver Imperative.
	¥¥¥¥ Implant Memories- this ability allows the telepath to place
	false memories in the mind of a victim with a Manipulation +
	Telepathy roll (difficulty of the victim's Willpower). If they do
	not fit logically with the rest of the victim's memories, then they
	are easily rejected (a simple Intelligence + Alertness check,
	difficulty as low as 3) as false, but more insidious memories are
	extremely difficult to verify, and may well be impossible to reject.
	The Storyteller makes this determination. The use of this ability is
	usually extremely difficult to detect by the victim.  Requires the
	Stunts: Subtle Implant, Deliver Imperative, Alter Senses.
	¥¥¥¥ Mental Blocks- you can erect a block (roll Telepathy, count the
	successes) in a target's mind to keep him from performing a certain
	action.  If the target attempts to perform the action anyway, he
	requires as many successes on a Willpower check as you got successes
	to erect the block.  Destroying the block in this way takes an action.
	Requires the Stunts: Implant Memories and Alter Senses.
	¥¥¥¥ Sensory overload- force a sense to shut down temporarily.  No
	permanent damage.  Difficulty of the target's Stamina.  Requires the
	Stunts: Alter Senses and Dominate.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral Form- the mutant can project her mind into the Umbra
	(Charisma + Telepathy, difficulty 8), allowing her to see the auras
	of other people and engage in Astral combat (using Telepathy and
	other mental powers only). The mutant's Telepathy difficulties on
	the Astral Plane are reduced by two. She is given an idealized body,
	which has as many Health Levels as she has Temporary Willpower. Each
	Health Level taken in Astral combat drains a point of Temporary
	Willpower (doing no real physical damage) until it is gone, at which
	point the telepath is shunted back into her body, losing a Permanent
	point of Willpower. She may elect to return to her body at any time.
	Significant travel is not possible without extended practice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Astral possession- Requires the Stunt: Astral Form.  You can
	skinride like a wraith and take over a body.  Once inside the host, a
	battle of wills takes place- each round, the two contest each other in
	a Willpower check (diff 4).  The victor drains one point from the
	loser's supply of Temporary Willpower.  When one or the other is
	reduced to zero Willpower, hegemony over the body is determined.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Mental Assault- the mutant can send psychic bolts to attack a
	victim's brain, causing many of the victim's synapses to fire at
	once. This attack roll is resolved with Wits + Telepathy (difficulty
	of the victim's Willpower) and the damage if successful is an
	Intelligence roll (difficulty 6). This may be soaked with Stamina as
	usual, and may be actively resisted with Endopathy or
	Biomanipulation. As usual, Psychic Invulnerability completely
	protects the mutant from this assault, and Telepathic
	Indetectibility removes one die per Rank from the telepath's attack
	pool.  Requires all Rank ¥, Rank ¥¥, and Rank ¥¥¥ base stunts.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Psychic Surgery- this ability allows the telepath to enter a
	person's mindscape and repair damage to his mind directly. This
	requires an initial Charisma + Telepathy roll and the expenditure of
	a point of Willpower. Psychic Surgery allows the telepath to restore
	lost Willpower to the person, cure derangements, or break mental
	blocks. Each is an Intelligence + Empathy roll (difficulty varies)
	resisted by the person's own Willpower, unless he spends a point of
	Willpower to deliberately surpress this knee-jerk response.  Requires
	the Stunt: Mental Assault.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Astral survival- live through the destruction of your body!
	Good luck getting another one, though...  Requires Astral Form.

Teleportation (Social) [AL]
	Teleportation is the ability to move instantaneously from one place to
	another, with no loss of mass.  Most teleporters can instinctively avoid
	entering spaces with matter in them.  This power only allows teleportation
	of self at the beginning, but teleport other can be learned as a power
	stunt.  This can be used at higher levels to devastating effect if 
	combined with clairvoyance.  Normally, the 'porter's personal effects 
	accompany him.  Nightcrawler and Blink are teleporters. Roll Stamina +
	Teleportation (diff 3 + the effective Rank of the range).
	
	¥ Range of 5 metres
	¥¥ Line of sight, or 1 mile
	¥¥¥ Anywhere you've been on Earth, or within 30 miles
	¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on Earth
	¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere in the solar system
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Anywhere in the galaxy
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Anywhere in this dimension
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Warp space
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Teleport other (up to one other person per level!)- the mutant can
	bring along other people when he teleports.
	¥ Spatial perceptions- if the mutant concentrates, she can 'feel' the
	shape of things in her immediate area.  This is useful in the dark.
	Perception + Teleport, diff 6.
	¥¥ Chain teleport (can be used to get where you're going in short steps;
	can be combined with teleport other to disorient a victim for a round
	+2 to all difficulties)  Stamina + Teleport at +2 difficulty.
	¥¥¥ Follow the leader- if an enemy teleports to a space within the
	mutant's range, he may follow in that same round (or the following
	round)-- though he will not know the destination.  This requires a
	Perception + Teleportation (diff of the enemy's Rank in TP + 3).
	¥¥¥ Teleport object (without teleporting yourself!)
	¥¥¥ Smoothporting [AH]- requires the stunt: Chain teleport.  The mutant
	teleports in continuous tiny steps, such that it requires a successful
	Perception check to realize that she is not floating or flying.  This
	requires a Manipulation + Teleportation (diff 7-- more successes will
	increase the 'smoothness' of the effect).
	¥¥¥¥/¥ Teleport across the Gauntlet- requires the Umbral Travel power and
	a successful step-sideways roll, but ignoring the duration of the latter.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Warp knives (Nasty!)- small extended spatial warps that actually
	bend space violently around them, forcing matter to get out of their
	way.  Can cause hideous damage.  Dex + Directed Blast.  Three dice 
	damage in the pool per success.

Telesthesia (Mental) [AL/AH]
	The Astral plane (or the Psychic plane) is a strange region, full of
	bizarre energies and vibrations that only a trained and talented mind
	may notice and decipher.  Telepaths, for instance, can detect and
	interpret psychic vibrations on a relatively narrow band, which allows
	them to read human minds.  An Animal Telepath has a somewhat broader
	range.  Precogs receive and interpret different data, as do those who
	are sensitive to psychic impressions from objects.  Magicians must
	concentrate carefully to interpret any such data.  The telesthetic
	trumps them all.  She can receive a broad band of vibrations, and has
	a variety of filters with which to interpret the data she receives.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant may simulate the following abilities at limited
	Ranks (the lowest available, so Telepathy effects are as Rank one,
	while Psychic Impressions are as Rank two): Telepathy, Precognition,
	Postcognition, Passive Empathy, Detection (Magic), Emanation Tracking,
	Detection (Danger Sense), Detection (Psi Talent), Aura Sight,
	Detection (Telelocation), Detection (Life), Clairaudience, 
	Clairvoyance.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥¥ Any of the above Powers may be purchased as a Power Stunt.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Cosmic Awareness, Alter Senses, or True Vision may also be
	Purchased as Power Stunts.

Temporal Manipulation* (Social) [AH]
	Using auras or coronas of energy, a mutant with this Power will be
	able to slow down or speed up the flow of time in a small area.  This
	can be used in a variety of applications, but there are a few tricks
	that remain beyond the grasp of a mutant using Temporal Manipulation:
	she cannot make time flow backward, or skip, or fragment.  She can, at
	high Ranks, slow it down to the point where it stops, however. The
	typical system for this Power is Manipulation + Temporal Man. (diff.
	varies, usually 6)
	
	¥ The mutant can make time seem to pass twice as quickly or half as
	quickly for a particular person or object (the victim gets a Stamina
	roll- difficulty 6- to resist any ill effects) or for all objects in a
	five-foot radius.  All Dodge difficulties for a person who has been
	slowed are increased by two; similarly, all Dodge difficulties for
	someone who has been hasted are decreased by two.  A hastened person's
	initiative successes are doubled, and a slowed person's initiative
	successes are halved.
	¥¥ The mutant can make time seem to pass three times or one third as
	quickly for a particular person or object (Stamina roll to resist any
	ill effects) or for all objects in a five-foot radius.  She can opt to
	increase the radius to ten feet if the time distortion is restricted
	to a Rank ¥ effect (twice or half as fast).
	¥¥¥ The mutant can make time seem to pass four times or one fourth as
	quickly for a particular person or object.  Conversation between
	affected and unaffected individuals becomes virtually impossible.
	Victims of a time compression effect receive two actions per round,
	but suffer from increased soak difficulty (diff 7).  Victims of
	dilation effects act only once every two rounds, but find that their
	flesh is far more durable- soaking is difficulty 4.  The area of
	effect is increased to a maximum of 15 feet for a Rank ¥ effect, 10
	feet for a Rank ¥¥ effect, or 5 feet for a Rank ¥¥¥ effect.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can make time pass five times or one fifth as quickly
	for a particular person or object.  At this speed, victims of
	compression effects will actually suffer from light mass wasting, and
	must make a Stamina check each round after the fifth round of exertion
	in order to avoid collapse.  The area of effect for all Ranks is
	effectively increased by 5 feet.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can make time seem to pass six times or one sixth as
	quickly for a particular person or object.  At this speed, victims of
	compression effects receive three actions per round, but begin to
	suffer from heavier mass wasting- in addition to the Stamina checks
	mentioned above, they receive a cumulative -1 die penalty to all
	actions per round after the fifth.  Soak difficulty is increased to 8.
	Single victims of dilation effects can actually be halted entirely,
	but are invulnerable to harm.  In area-effect dilations, the soak
	difficulty for victims is decreased to 3, and those affected may only
	act once every three rounds.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Layers- the mutant may overlay 'shells' of time distortion around
	an object or area, each with different time flow rates.  This requires
	that the mutant split her dice pool.  These shells are immobile.
	¥¥¥¥ Anchor- by spending a point of Power Charge, the mutant can increase
	the duration of a temporal distortion to one day per Rank (in real time).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Concentration- requires the Stunt: Layers.  The mutant can actually
	concentrate distortion effects by overlapping 'shells', as above.  A
	Rank five dilation effect (time moves six times as slowly) can be placed
	inside a Rank four dilation effect (time moves five times as slowly),
	for a net dilation of one thirtieth speed.

Tether (Social) [AL]
	This is an energy Power, and as such a type of energy should be chosen
	from the Energy List to complement it.  A mutant with this ability can
	confine a living subject to a particular place.  If the subject strays
	from that spot, energy assaults her body every round (no chance of a
	Dodge) until the effect wears off or she returns to her confinement.
	The mutant must be able to see the subject to attach the Tether, but
	he does not have to see her for the effect to work.  A Charisma +
	Tether roll (diff 6) is required to set a Tether.  The damage for
	this Power is one Health Level per Rank per round.
	
	¥ The effect lasts for one round, and a fifty-foot radius dome around
	the spot where the victim was standing when she was Tethered is the
	safety zone.  The victim is safe if she can travel fifty feet beyond
	the edge.
	¥¥ The effect lasts for one minute, and a safety zone as small as 
	forty feet in radius, or as large as one hundred feet.  The victim 
	will take no more damage if she can travel one hundred feet beyond the
	edge.
	¥¥¥ The effect lasts for ten minutes, and the safety zone can be
	as small as twenty feet in radius, or as large as two hundred feet.
	The victim will take no more damage if she can travel one mile
	beyond the edge.
	¥¥¥¥ The effect lasts for one hour, and the safety zone can be as
	small as ten feet in radius, or as large as one mile.  The victim
	will take no more damage if she can travel ten miles beyond the edge.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The effect lasts for one day, and the safety zone can be as
	small as five feet in radius (forcing most people to crouch) or as
	large as ten miles.  The victim will take no more damage if she can
	travel one hundred miles beyond the edge.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ As rank five, but the effect lasts for one week.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ As rank six, but the maximum size of the safety zone is
	increased ten times, as is the safe distance.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ As rank seven, but the effect lasts for a year.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ As rank eight, but the maximum size of the safety zone is
	the planet, and the safe distance is the boundary of the solar system.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ As rank nine, but the effect is permanent, and there is
	no safe distance.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ Snap- if the victim loses consciousness before leaving the danger
	zone, he will fly in a straight line toward the safety zone.  No
	further damage will accumulate until the victim is returned, unless
	he is prevented from returning (at least one round passes in which
	the victim does not make at least a little forward progress).  He
	is propelled with a Strength equal to the mutant's Rank in this Power,
	and at a speed of the equivalent Rank of Flight.

Time Travel (Mental) [AH]
	This is an extremely rare, extremely taxing Power that should be used
	sparingly.  The more common means of traveling time, by far, is that
	received through Life Force Absorption and Conversion.  Raw Time Travel
	is a difficult science that sucks the life out of the mutants who employ
	it.  It often has a strong disorienting effect (loss of memory, age
	regression, etc. are possible).  Only characters like Legion have (had)
	the ability to cross time with impunity, on the strength of their own
	Powers.  The Storyteller decides what's going to happen to hapless
	mutants who decide to muck with the time-stream too much...
	
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant 'burns' one point of Power Charge and then spends one
	point of Willpower for every year or fraction thereof that she wants to
	move forward or backward.  She can move back or forward a decade for
	every point of Power Charge that she 'burns' in addition. Other people
	can be brought along as well, but they also 'burn' off a point of Power
	Charge.  Up to 10 people can be brought along.

Total Recall (Mental) [AL]
	Your mutant remembers EVERYTHING. Period.  Anything he has ever read
	or seen or heard is stored in his brain, and it can be retrieved.  This
	does not mean that the mutant understood what it was that he read or
	saw, of course.  There is one minor drawback to this Power: it is easy
	for telepaths to evoke painful memories from you.  Roll a Willpower
	check (diff 4) to activate this Power.

	Special Flaw: Flashbacks (3 point Flaw)- whenever your mutant is faced
	with a situation similar to an especially painful episode in his
	life, he may 'remember' the pain associated with it.  A Willpower check
	(difficulty 8) is required to avoid this circumstance, which will even
	bestow the associated dice penalties from Health Level loss that are
	associated with the memory.

	¥¥¥¥ Your mutant remembers everything.  The Storyteller may not allow
	this Power, as it gets to be a royal pain in the ass.  Ask before you
	take it.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥ I Did It Again- by spending a point of Power Charge, the mutant
	may perfectly duplicate a feat in his instrumental memory (i.e., if
	he once got six successes when rebuilding the engine in a Blackbird,
	he may elect to take six successes again without rolling the dice).
	¥¥¥¥ Perfect Pull- requires the Power: Telepathy.  The mutant can also
	retrieve memories, flawlessly, from the brains of others when their
	defenses are down.

Transmutation* (Social) [AH]
	Any inorganic substance can be transformed into any element with the
	use of this Power, which was held most famously by Alchemy.  Here
	'organic' refers to any matter which is living or was formerly living-
	this stricture does not include matter that has been transformed over
	time, such as crude oil, nor does it include the gamut of compounds
	containing carbon.  It does, however, include blood and certain parts
	of topsoil, for instance.  The element that is the final product of
	the transmutation will appear at the temperature of the environment. 
	Rarity of the target element has no bearing on the difficulty of the
	task.  Note that any chemical bond to an organic substance (such as
	the bond that holds the adamantium to Sabretooth's bones) is
	sufficient to resist this Power.  The standard system is Charisma +
	Transmutation (difficulty 7).  The range of this Power is touch.
	
	¥ Up to 50 grams of a substance can be transmuted at a time.  The
	effects of the transmutation are permanent unless reversed by the
	mutant.
	¥¥ Up to one kilogram of a substance can be transmuted at a time.
	¥¥¥ Up to twenty kilograms can be transmuted at a time.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to 100 kilograms can be transmuted at a time.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to a tonne can be transmuted at a time.

True Mimicry* (Physical/Social/Mental) [AN]
	The most powerful version of Physical Imitation, this Power comes with
	a price.  Copycat, the former lover of Deadpool and current paramour
	of Kane, has the ability to duplicate not only the physical form of
	another person, but also that person's unique psychic imprint and even
	Powers- however, this Power operates through long-term contact.  The
	more time that the mutant spends with the original, the closer the
	copy will be- and the more like the victim the mutant will become.
	The mutant can spend as much time in the original's form as she likes,
	but as soon as she abandons the form she cannot reassume it- though
	she can of course spend more time with the original to reassume the
	form, and the second time she does this, she assumes the qualities
	of the original twice as quickly.  The roll to assume a person's
	physical form is Stamina + True Mimicry (difficulty equal to 5 plus
	the largest discrepancy between Physical Attributes- for example,
	for Copycat (Str. 3) to duplicate the Beast (Str. 7) would require
	a Stamina + True Mimicry roll diff 9).  The roll to assume a person's
	psychic imprint is Charisma + True Mimicry (diff 6).  The roll
	to assume a person's memories is Intelligence + True Mimicry (diff 7).
	The roll to assume a person's Powers is Stamina + True Mimicry (diff
	of 3 + the victim's highest Rank- any Powers that the victim has
	that are of higher Rank than the mutant's Actual Power Level are
	duplicated at that lower Rank if possible, or left out if impossible).
	The change of form cannot be 'held off' while the mutant spends
	time with the original, but is a gradual process.

	¥ The mutant can duplicate a person's physical form in an hour of
	contact, his psychic imprint in two hours, his principal memories
	in three hours, and his Powers starting at four hours- one hour
	per Rank.  However, the mutant's behavior and beliefs (certainly
	her Demeanor and eventually even her nature) start changing after
	hour two.  The mutant sheds all of her Powers other than this one
	to duplicate the new person (especially Matter Body: Metal and
	the like).  Unobtrusive Powers, such as Telepathy, do not disappear
	until the mutant starts duplicating her victim's Powers.
	¥¥ The mutant can duplicate a person's physical form in a half
	hour of contact, his psychic imprint in an hour, his principal
	memories in an hour and a half, and his Powers starting at two
	hours- one half hour per Rank.  At hour three, she has fine detail
	in the victim's memories.  The mutant's behavior and beliefs start
	changing after hour two.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can duplicate a person's physical form in 15 minutes,
	his psychic imprint in 30 minutes, his principal memories in 45
	minutes, and his Powers starting at an hour- 15 minutes per Rank.
	At 75 minutes, she has fine detail in the victim's memories and
	has unconsciously picked up his mannerisms.  The mutant's behavior
	and beliefs start changing after an hour.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can duplicate a person's physical form in 5 minutes,
	his psychic imprint in 10 minutes, his principal memories in 15
	minutes, and his Powers starting at 20 minutes- 5 minutes per
	Rank.  At 30 minutes, she has fine detail in the victim's memories
	and mannerisms.  The mutant's behavior and beliefs start changing
	after an hour.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can duplicate a person's physical form in a minute,
	his psychic imprint in two minutes, his principal memories in three
	minutes, and his Powers starting at four minutes- one minute per
	Rank.  At five minutes, the mutant has fine detail in the victim's
	memories and mannerisms.  The mutant's behavior and beliefs start
	changing after ten minutes.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Gritting the Teeth- the mutant can spend one Willpower point
	per ten minutes of contact to avoid becoming like the victim.

Tunneling (Physical) [PN]
	Like Helmut (John Lynch's old foe in the Wildstorm line), a mutant
	with this Power can dig into the earth and move at an amazing rate.
	Sand, loam, and even clay can be dug away with amazing facility.  Of
	course, if the mutant doesn't have anywhere to put the soil, it is
	merely deposited behind him, but so long as he digs air passages with
	some regularity, this will not prove to be a problem.  A mutant with
	this Power usually has digging claws of some kind- these make a
	Strength + 1 weapon when used in combat.  Typically, this Power does 
	not require a roll- when it does, it is a Strength + Tunneling roll.
	
	Variation: Corrosive Tunneling [AL]- the mutant with this variation
	does not possess claws or other physiological digging tools, but
	instead uses a chemical agent 	to move the earth out of the way. The
	chemical is sprayed (from the pores, the mouth, or whatever) onto the
	dirt and rock, which quickly dissolves into a thin sludge.  This costs
	two extra freebie points (or experience points) per Rank, and otherwise
	acts like Secretions (Acid) at the same Rank, using the Stream
	configuration.
	
	Variation: Energy Tunneling (Social) [AL]- this variation uses a
	specialized energy (either Energy Force, or a form of disintegration)
	to blast the earth out of the way.  The shape of the energy beam is
	such that it is focused, or tapered at some distance removed from the
	mutant, but otherwise acts as a beam.  If the mutant takes the Energy
	Force version, it acts as the Energy Emission of the same Rank, with
	the beam variation, and costs 3 extra Freebie points (or experience)
	per Rank.  Otherwise, it should be treated as a tightly focused version
	of Seismic Assault affecting only inorganic material.  In this form,
	Energy Tunneling does not cost extra.
	
	¥ The mutant can move up to six feet per round under the earth
	¥¥ The mutant can move up to twelve feet
	¥¥¥ Eighteen feet
	¥¥¥¥ Twenty-four feet
	¥¥¥¥¥ Thirty feet
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Sixty feet
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Concrete/Rock- the mutant can tunnel through concrete or rock at
	normal movement rates.
	¥¥ Metal- light metals (anything up to the hardness of iron ore
	or bronze) can be tunneled through at the normal rate.
	¥¥¥ Heavy Metal- armoured or reinforced surfaces, and metals to
	the strength of titanium can be tunneled through at half the
	normal rate.
	¥¥¥ Low Centre of Gravity- the mutant may purchase the Power:
	Immovability with Experience points, though its Rank must always
	be at least two less than his Rank in Tunneling.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Fortress- materials to the strength of adamantium ore or
	refined carbonadium can be tunneled through at half the normal
	rate.

Umbral Travel (Mental) [AL]
	This power, rare indeed among mutantkind, allows the mutant to seep
	across the Gauntlet where it is weak and enter the Penumbra.  What
	you do when you get there is your own business.  See Werewolf: the
	Apocalypse, Umbra: the Velvet Shadow, and Axis Mundi for more info
	on the Umbra and its spirits.  No roll is required.  The mutant
	may buy the Talent: Awareness with Freebies or Experience.
	
	¥ You can cross the Gauntlet, after about 20 minutes of preparation,
	if the rating is only 3.
	¥¥ You can cross at places where the Gauntlet is 4.  10 minutes.
	¥¥¥ Gauntlet 5.  5 minutes.
	¥¥¥¥ Gauntlet 6. 1 minute.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Gauntlet 7. 1 round.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ See across Gauntlet- any place where your mutant can cross over
	(where the Gauntlet is weak enough), she can observe events on the
	other side.  Perception + Awareness, diff 4.
	¥¥¥¥ Shift across the Shroud- the mutant can choose to enter the
	Shadowlands (the Umbra of the dead) instead of the Penumbra.  The
	same restrictions for Gauntlet numbers apply to the Shroud.

Unique Physiology (Physical) [PN]
	This isn't a Power that you get if you want your mutant to be double-
	jointed or tall.  A mutant with this Power has physiology so bizarre
	that it defies the standards of modern medicine or even life as we
	know it.  He may have manganese-based bones instead of calcium-based
	ones, or he may breathe through pits in his skin.  Hell, he might be a
	silicon- based life form or have copper-based blood.  Whatever floats
	your boat.  In any case, it is likely that his dietary needs are going
	to be different than a normal human's.  Note that any body
	modifications that can be simulated using Extra Body Parts or Body
	Weaponry should be purchased using those Powers.  Count this Power
	only once toward the character creation limit, no matter how many
	times it is taken.

	¥ Each unusual body trait should be purchased separately (each is its
	own Rank one Power).  If it is a trait that can cause damage (such as
	acidic blood, for instance, increase the cost by one Rank per die of
	damage beyond one.  Acidic blood that caused five Health Levels of
	damage per exposure would be a Rank five Power.  Radically increasing
	the mutant's blood pressure so that the acid would fountain whenever
	the mutant was cut would be a separate (Rank one) Power.  Acidic saliva
	is a Body Weapon.

Unstoppable (Physical) [AN]
	The Juggernaut makes the most of his ability to resist mere Telekinesis,
	steel walls, forcefields, and other minor inconveniences because of
	this Power.  The character may not be literally unstoppable, but he
	will certainly seem like it once he starts moving.  No roll is required.
	
	¥ Subtract one success from any TK attack made against you to damage
	or to constrict when moving; You can move through any forcefield that
	has only two soak dice without slowing down; three dice will take you
	a round.  Any material up to the strength of leather can be smashed
	through in any thickness.  Add 5 to your Strength pool for the purposes
	of resisting grapples or entanglement if you are already in motion.
	¥¥ Subtract two successes from any TK attack against you to damage or
	constrict when moving; move through any forcefield that has only three
	dice of soak without slowing down; six dice will take you a round.  Any
	material of up to the strength of hard wood can be smashed through in
	any thickness.  Add 6 to your Strength pool vs. grapples or entanglement.
	¥¥¥ Subtract three successes from any TK attack against you; move through

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Subtract seven successes from any TK attack against you; move
	through any forcefield without slowing up to ten dice; fifteen dice
	will take a round.  Any material of up to the strength of carbonadium

	Bands of Cytorrak, whatever their strength.  You can smash through
	materials up to the strength of Uru in any thickness.  Add 15 to your
	Strength pool vs. grappling or entanglement.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Mega-Strength- buy the Power: Mega-Strength with Experience points.

Vacuum Manipulation (Social) [AH]
	This is an extremely bizarre power.  The mutant can create vacuums in
	inorganic matter and hold them with concentration for as long as he
	desires, and then 'let go', which usually creates a sucking effect.
	This has a number of possible applications, but the mutant certainly
	is forced to be creative.  The matter cannot rush into the vacuum
	so long as concentration is maintained.  Gas 'slaps' deliver one Health
	Level of damage per ten foot radius, Liquids one Health Level per five
	feet, Solids one Health Level per 2 and a half feet.  Manipulation +
	Vacuum Manipulation, diff 6 (gasses), diff 7 (liquids), diff 9 
	(solids).

	¥ Only gasses can be displaced, in a 5' radius sphere
	¥¥ Gasses, 10' radius, Liquids 5' radius
	¥¥¥ Gasses 15' radius, Liquids 10' radius, Solids 5' radius
	¥¥¥¥ Gasses 20' radius, Liquids 15' radius, Solids 10' radius

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ No Air- the mutant does not need to breathe.
	¥¥¥¥ Suffocate- the mutant can suffocate people by creating vacuums in
	the interior of their lungs.  Dexterity + Vacuum, diff 9.

Vampiric Feedback (Social) [PN]
	A mutant who has this power will not be drained of her reserves,
	period.  Psychic Vampires and even normal vampires must be wary of
	someone who has this Power, for she can turn the tables on them using
	their own assault.  Vampires and Bio-Vampires, when they attempt to
	drain the mutant's blood, begin bleeding through their pores at a rate
	of four Blood Points per round, for as long as they keep up the
	assault.  Psychic Vampires find their Power turning on them, and they
	lose a point of Willpower per round while they press the attack.  Life
	Force Vampires lose a Health Level per round.  No roll is required.
	
	¥¥ Any vampire who tries to drain this character will pay dearly for
	his presumption.

Vertigo (Social) [AH]
	The ability to mess with another character's sense of balance is not
	one to be trifled with.  Vertigo of the Marauders has this power.  The
	effects can range from light disorientation to uncontrollable vomiting.
	This power requires concentration and a Stamina + Vertigo roll (diff
	of the victim's Stamina + Acrobatics).
	
	¥ Victim suffers a +1 difficulty to all actions, and has one less
	success on any Acrobatics, Firearms, or Missiles roll.
	¥¥ Victim suffers a +2 difficulty to all actions, and has one less
	success on any of the rolls above.
	¥¥¥ Victim suffers a +3 difficulty to all actions.  She must make
	a Dexterity + Athletics roll (diff 8) or fall over.  Two successes
	are lost from the rolls above.
	¥¥¥¥ Victim suffers a +4 diff to all actions.  She must make a Dex +
	Athletics check (diff 8) to keep her balance, and a Stamina check
	(diff 7) must be made before attempting any action.  Two successes
	are lost from the rolls above.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Victim suffers a +5 diff to all actions.  She must make a Dex +
	Athletics check (diff 9) to keep her balance,  and a Stamina check
	(diff 8) before attempting any action.  Three successes are lost
	from the rolls above.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Balance- the mutant has one automatic Athletics success for any
	balance roll.
	¥¥¥¥ Burst- the mutant can agitate the fluid in the semi-circular
	canals of the victim so violently that they burst, inflicting one
	Health Level of damage that cannot be soaked with Stamina and making
	any movement that requires balance improbable at best (keep up the
	penalties assessed by her Power Rank without concentration).

Vibration Blast (Social) [AL]
	As with the Shocker, the mutant can create catastrophic vibration in
	solid, liquid, and gas in a tightly-focused beam.  It generally does
	precious little damage to gases (though it can disperse them or drag
	them along with the beam), but solids suffer badly.  In fact, the
	harder the solid is, the worse it fares.  Metals will fatigue, crystals
	will shatter, and any kind of suspension (like concrete) is likely to
	crack or even crumble to dust.  Flesh doesn't exactly react well to it,
	either.  Use the same damage as with Energy Powers, difficulty six to
	soak.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Stun- if the target suffers more damage than he has Stamina, he is
	stunned for a round for every point that the damage roll exceeded the
	Stamina.

Vibration Channeling (Social) [AL]
	The mutant can channel destructive vibrations by touch, either through
	a conductive medium (such as water, a weapon, or the ground) or
	directly into a person's body.  This delivers two Health Levels of
	damage per Rank in this Power, which can be added to Brawl or Melee
	attacks in certain cases.  It can also give something like a sword or
	knife increased cutting power; consider the weapon to have been shifted
	up the Matter Hardening scale by one Rank per Rank in this Power.  Note
	that many media will take serious damage from channeling this Power,
	and will not last long as a weapon.

Vibration Control (Social) [AL]
	The mutant has the ability to amplify or deaden the vibration waves
	that exist in all media with deadly results.  The Shocker has this
	power, though when it comes to its application he is an idiot.  A
	solid medium will naturally be more susceptible to this power, which
	makes it possible that Avalanche's earthquake power is a weak form
	of this ability.  Don't jump on the trampoline with him.  Requires
	a Charisma + Vibration Control (diff 4 + Rank).
	
	¥ Add or subtract one die to damage pools from sound attacks and any
	other vibration attack in air, two dice in liquid, three in solid.
	¥¥ Add/Subtract two dice in air, three in liquid, four in solid.
	¥¥¥ Add/Subtract three dice in air, four in liquid, five in solid.
	¥¥¥¥ Add/Subtract four dice in air, five in liquid, six in solid.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Add/Subtract five dice in air, six in liquid, seven in solid.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Earthquake- by stomping, or creating some other small disturbance,
	the mutant can create an earthquake and open cracks in the ground, etc.
	¥¥¥ Stun- if the target is in liquid or is struck by a solid, and
	suffers more damage than he has Stamina, he is stunned for a round for
	every point that the damage roll exceeded the Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Splatter- the mutant can turn a simple throbbing headache into a
	lethal experience, causing the blood vessels in the brain to rupture
	and inflicting one non-soakable level of damage per success on a
	Vibration Control roll (difficulty eight).  Similarly, the mutant can 
	set up cataclysmic vibrations in the mutant's heart or vocal chords 
	which will cause serious internal damage. [AH]

Vision of Decay (Mental) [AN]
	Unlike many Altered Perceptions, Vision of Decay is not an ability
	that can be turned on and off at will.  Many who have had this Power
	might wish that it could.  Like Raistlin Majere of the Dragonlance
	novels, your mutant can see the ravages of time and decay on the people
	and things around him.  People seem to age, steel rusts, wood
	dries and cracks, food grows mould and rots away entirely.  The mutant
	can also perceive the dead, as their wraiths float around the world,
	and he can hear them speak.  No roll is required.
	
	¥ The mutant sees visions of death and the dead.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Dark Premonition- if the mutant meets someone who will die in the
	next twenty-four hours, he can see the manner of her death (if the
	person was going to be hanged, for instance, her eyes would be
	bulging, her face would be discoloured, there would be scars on her
	neck, and possibly even the ghostly suggestion of a rope).
	¥ Howling Emptiness- the mutant may give suggestions of what she
	sees to people with whom she locks gazes.  This will often scare
	the hell out of people, who must make a Willpower check in order to
	keep on an even keel.  If the victim fails, he has +1 difficulty in
	all Social and Mental rolls vs. the mutant for that scene.
	¥ Stink of Death- if a person has ever committed murder, the mutant
	can perceive an odour of rot around her, and perhaps even see the
	faces of her victims.

Voice of Command (Social/Mental) [AL]
	Like the Preacher, when your character chooses to speak, others must
	listen.  Although this power is related to Persuasion, it does not
	require a rationale; it is not insidious, but simply raw and powerful.
	It will be obvious to the more intelligent folks what is going on,
	even as they find themselves unable to resist your commands.  Most
	mutants with this power can turn it on and off at will.  Those who
	have the ability to turn it off must spend a Willpower point to
	activate the command; those who cannot are probably not long for this
	world (or at least they won't talk much).  Listeners who do not
	understand your language are not affected by this power.  Telepathic
	defenses are not a very efficient defense (diff 8 to resist), but
	Iron Will retains its effectiveness.
	
	Special Flaw: Pure Heart (2-point Flaw) Your character cannot issue
	an order that is not good or moral (or at least, he must perceive it
	as fully justified).  Any such order lacks the ring of Command.
	
	Special Flaw: Full Tilt (3-point Flaw) Although your character does
	not need to spend Willpower points to activate this power, he can
	never shut it off.  Every statement he makes has the ring of Command.
	This Flaw can be taken with the Pure Heart Flaw (which will allow
	the character to make statements like "give me all your money, you
	old bat" without Commanding). [AN]
	
	¥ The character makes a Charisma + Voice of Command roll when he wants
	to make his will known.  All listeners may resist with a Willpower
	check.  Simple commands, like to touch toes, drop weapons, or kiss
	your neighbour can be issued; Extended actions (requiring more than
	one muscle movement) must be treated as a sequence of orders.  Orders
	to stab loved ones or push them off of cliffs, etc. are completely
	ignored.
	¥¥ Same system of command and resistance.  Commands to engage in non-
	harmful attacks (wrestling) or to engage in a simple or familiar
	task can be issued (follow me, go home, clear away that rubble) with
	impunity.  Orders issued to a person to attack her own enemies are
	also usually followed.  Carpenters can be ordered to build a doghouse.
	Again, radical orders (jump off that cliff, kill your mother) are
	ignored.
	¥¥¥ Commands can be issued to engage in non-lethal attacks (fistfights)
	or to attempt more complex or unfamiliar tasks.  If the orator strays
	from the victim's presence when the victim is engaged in an unfamiliar
	and unpalatable task, he immediately gets another Willpower check at
	difficulty four to stop doing it.  Commands can also be issued to
	omit performing tasks at this level, which can be extremely unpalatable
	(don't kill your worst enemy) and still effective in most cases.  Of
	course, orders to stop breathing or not to resist an attack will still
	be ignored.
	¥¥¥¥ Commands can be issued to employ powers and body in potentially
	lethal attacks, even on friends (though the difficulty to resist making
	an attack on a friend is at -2).  Simple one-line commands, like 'stab
	that person with that knife', are possible at this level.  The more
	palatable an action is, the harder it is at this level to resist; 
	likewise, an unpalatable action is easier to resist.  Directly suicidal
	commands are still ignored (jump off that cliff, stand in that fire)
	but indirectly suicidal commands (attack the Juggernaut, kiss Doom)
	are resisted normally, if at all.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Commands to kill others or engage in ridiculous activities (jump
	out of the plane, stab yourself) can be issued, and resisted normally,
	if at all.  A character cannot be ordered not to defend himself against
	an attack, and if ordered to stand in a fire, will regain control over
	himself immediately after having done so.  Extreme desperation tends
	to free victims from the mutant's control.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Persuasion Immunity- the character cannot be Persuaded or subjected
	to this power by another character.
	¥¥ Mega-Charisma- the character may purchase the power: Mega-Charisma
	with experience points, even if he did not start with that power.  This
	allows a character who did not choose the Social category to improve
	his Charisma beyond the fifth level.
	¥¥ Psychic Defense- the mutant may purchase the power: Psychic Defense
	with experience points, even if he did not start with that power.
	¥¥¥ Resist Domination- the mutant is immune to Domination and the Blood
	Bond if he purchases this Stunt.
	¥¥¥¥ Dark Reward- the people who follow the mutant's commands willingly
	and without struggle are rewarded with a surge to the  brain's pleasure
	center.  This can be highly addictive, and may attract a following for
	the mutant of people who seek to do his bidding.  Offering the Dark
	Reward costs a point of Temporary Willpower the first five times it is
	given to a certain person; then the barrier breaks down and it becomes
	free.  Psychic defenses can prevent the recipient from getting the
	Dark Reward.

Wallcrawling (Physical) [PN]
	This is the ability to climb sheer surfaces without trouble or penalty.
	While Adhesion gives this ability incidentally, this actually implies
	something about the nature of the mutant's hands and feet.  Both the
	Nightcrawler and the Beast have this Power.  All difficulties to climb
	any surface (so long as climbing is possible) are lowered by 4.
	
	Common Variations:
	* Climbing Claws- the mutant's hands and feet are equipped with short,
	tough, hooked claws that make climbing easy.  They give the mutant a
	Strength + 1 claw attack that is capable of biting into soft stone.
	* Manipulative Feet- this variant must be bought at character creation
	(unless you've got a REALLY good reason for buying it later).  The
	mutant can use his feet to perform any functions that hands could, at a
	+2 difficulty.  At double cost, the feet are equally as facile as hands
	(no increase in difficulty).
	* Static charge- your mutant's hands and feet give off a powerfully
	attractive charged field that will allow him to adhere to nearly any
	surface.
	* Suckers- this variant must be bought at character creation (again).
	Your hands and/or feet are covered with many tiny little suckers which
	make it easy for you to bear your weight.  +2 difficulty for anyone to
	dislodge you from your wall, and a +1 bonus to Strength dice pools for
	any relevant grappling or disarm check ONLY.

	¥ The mutant can climb walls and other sheer surfaces very easily.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Crushing grip- your hands (and perhaps feet) have been designed to
	'lock'-- it's almost impossible to pry your grip open.  You may inflict
	Strength + 1 damage per round, just with your grip.
	¥ Effortless Dodge- due to your natural movement advantages on sheer
	surfaces, you suffer no difficulty penalty whatsoever when dodging
	while climbing.
	¥ Toughened joints- your knees, elbows, ankles, and wrists are designed
	to take much greater stress than a normal human's.  You are at +2
	difficulty to be disarmed or tripped, and your maximum press is
	doubled.
	¥ Vertigo- your mutant has enhanced proprioception and balance- he
	always lands on his feet (-1 diff to soak falling damage) and is immune
	to inner-ear balance-affecting attacks (such as the Vertigo Power, or
	certain kinds of Biomanipulation).

Water Breathing (Physical) [PN]
	Your mutant can breathe underwater as well as on land.  She may have
	gills, or some other mechanism for extracting the oxygen from water- it
	doesn't matter.  Anywhere fish can go, you can go.  Namor has this
	ability.  No roll is required.
	
	¥ The mutant can breathe normally underwater, if there is any oxygen
	dissolved in it.  Fresh and salt water are both breathable to the
	mutant.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Darksight- you may purchase Altered Perceptions: Low-light vision
	with Experience.
	¥ Dense flesh- the mutant's skin is thick and dense enough to allow
	an auto-soak against blunt trauma.
	¥ No bends- due to some peculiarity of her physiology, the mutant does
	not suffer from the bends, and may ascend or descend at any speed she
	desires without encountering nitrogen-related difficulties.
	¥ Sharkskin- your skin is rough and ridged like a shark's, while
	appearing smooth.  Anyone trying to grapple you is in for a big
	surprise; you inflict a point of damage on any soft substance (like
	skin or leather) if you rub it violently against the grain of your
	skin.

Weather Control (Social) [AL]
	Like Storm of the X-Men or Rainmaker of Gen-13, your mutant has the
	ability to change the way the weather's working.  As both of the 
	ladies just mentioned have proven, this is not a Power to be taken
	lightly, since heat, cold, wind, rain, and lightning are all part
	and parcel of this ability.  There are innumerable Power Stunts
	that can be developed for it.  Charisma + Weather Control, diff
	of the Rank of the effect + 3.
	
	¥ Change temperature by +/- 10 degrees Celsius, change humidity by up
	to 30% either way, generate or quash stiff breezes (20 mph).
	¥¥ Change temperature by +/- 20 degrees Celsius, change humidity by as
	much as 50% in either direction, change electrostatic charge in the
	air to call lightning (Int + Directed Blast, diff 8 to hit), generate
	or quash a strong wind (60 mph), golf ball-sized hail is possible.
	¥¥¥ Change temperature by +/- 30 degrees Celsius, change humidity by
	as much as 75% in either direction, change electrostatic charge in the
	air to such a degree that you can generate electrical bolts yourself
	(One Health Level in the damage pool per Rank), generate or quash a
	gale-force wind (100 mph), create fist-sized hail if the temperature
	is right.
	¥¥¥¥ Change temperature by +/- 50 degrees Celsius, change humidity by
	up to 100%, if necessary, generate or quash hurricane-force winds
	(200 mph), create football-sized hail (lethal!), control the movement
	of any electrical current in the area by manipulating the
	electrostatic charge.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Change temperature by +/- 80 degrees Celsius, change humidity
	by up to 200% (doubling the carrying capacity of the air), generate
	or quash tornado-force winds (400 mph), create basketball-sized hail
	(ouch), and generally do bad stuff.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The range of the mutant's abilities extends beyond line-of-sight
	to forty miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ One hundred miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Five hundred miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Three thousand miles.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Anywhere on the planet.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Weather immunity- your character is indifferent to extremes of
	temperature, is not touched by rain if she doesn't want to be, and
	has an automatic soak success per Rank against electricity.
	¥¥ Static Discharge- the mutant may fire bolts of electricity (damage
	is one die per Rank).
	¥¥¥ Electrical discharge- the mutant may purchase the Powers Energy
	Emission (Electricity), Energy Resistance (Electricity) or Energy
	Channeling (Electricity) with Experience.  Requires the Stunt: Static
	Discharge.
	¥¥¥ Flight- concentrated bursts of air movement allow your mutant to
	propel herself through the air.  Since she can control air currents,
	she will have no breathing problems.  Flight speed depends on the
	speeds of the winds she can summon.
	¥¥¥ Wind Shield- the mutant can create so strong a wind that he can
	make fields that soak and pushes away physical attacks and missile
	attacks and absorbs 2 dice per rank from them.  Against certain energy
	attacks (such as fire, plasma, and energy force) it soaks one dice per
	rank.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Cutting Wind- the mutant can propel air molecules (or sand, or
	whatever) with sufficient speed and in the proper configuration to
	actually cut open opponents (Damage is resolved as Firearms, with a
	Perception + Directed Blast- diff 8- being the dice pool used to hit-
	base damage is 2).  Difficulty 7 to soak.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ New Planet- the mutant can adapt her power to affect the
	weather patterns of a new planet after a few days of study.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ New Systems- the mutant can adapt her Weather Control Power to
	affect new semi-chaotic systems, such as ocean currents or the solar
	wind.  This requires the expenditure of a permanent Willpower point,
	and will require another such expenditure to switch back.

Weight-Shifting (Physical) [AL]
	A truly unusual Power, closely related to Mass-Shifting.  The mutant
	cannot change her overall mass (nor shift down to intangibility, except
	at the higher levels), but she can actually shift around her 'center'
	of mass, effectively concentrating her mass in a particular part of her
	body (much like changing your center of gravity, or shifting your
	weight- only more extreme).  At any rate, the mutant can decide exactly
	how much of her body's total mass is contained by any one part of her
	body.  The roll for this is Stamina + Weight-Shifting (diff varies on
	the level of concentration, typically diff 4).

	¥¥ The mutant can perform amazing feats of weight-shifting,
	concentrating her mass in various parts of her body.  This can give her
	extra Strength dice in that part (up to two points of it, never more
	than double Strength), or bonuses to Athletics rolls, Dodge rolls, or
	Acrobatics rolls if used creatively.  The mutant's density in any given
	body part cannot more than triple.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can shift parts of her body all the way down to
	intangibility.  Her density in any given body part can increase as much
	as ten times.  Up to three points of Strength or Stamina can be granted
	in a particularly dense part.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant's density in any given body part can increase as much
	as fifty times (if she has enough mass to do so).  Up to five points of
	Strength or Stamina.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's density in any given body part can increase as much
	as one hundred times (if she has enough mass to do so).  Up to seven
	points of Strength or Stamina.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥¥¥ Aggressive Weight-Shifting- Yucky!  The mutant can (with a touch)
	cause someone to weight-shift in a particular way.  This lasts as long
	as the mutant is touching him or holds light concentration.

Well of Knowledge (Social/Mental) [AN]
	This Power, related to Yesterscape and the Dream Background, connects
	the mutant intimately to the collective unconscious of the human race.
	Each Rank in this Power offers the mutant three extra ability dots that
	can be placed as per the mutant's variation of this Power.  The ability
	arrangement can be shifted using an action (Perception + Well of
	Knowledge) at any time.  Each ability category (Talents, Skills, and
	Knowledges) is a separate variation.

	The difficulty to access particular abilities is as follows:

	* Common abilities (widely known languages, brawl, drive) are diff 4.
	* Less common abilities (computer hacking, martial arts, mimicry) are
	diff 6.
	* Exotic abilities (vampire lore, genetics, stunned maneuver) are
	diff 8 (or more, at the ST's option).

	One success on the mutant's roll means that the ability or abilities in
	question are 'downloaded' at a rate of one dot per round.  No further
	concentration beyond the initial action is required during this time.
	Two successes means that the mutant can either improve two abilities at
	a rate of one dot per round, or one ability at a rate of two dots per
	round.  On a botch, the mutant's mind is blasted (he loses a point of
	Power Charge) and all of the abilities he's stored bleed back into the
	collective unconscious.  He must spend a point of Willpower to perform
	any action for a number of turns equal to the effective Rank of this
	Power that he was using (i.e., if he's shifting three ability points,
	he is affected for one turn.  If he's shifting ten, he's affected for
	four turns).

	Variation: Talents- the mutant can draw Talents from the collective
	unconscious.

	Variation: Skills- the mutant can draw Skills from the collective
	unconscious. 

	Variation: Knowledge- the mutant can draw points of Knowledge from the
	collective unconscious.

	¥ The mutant can draw three dots of abilities (in either Talents, Skills,
	or Knowledges).  These dots may all be in one ability, or they can be
	spread out over multiple abilities.  To access a new ability, the mutant
	decides which of his 'augmented' abilities is going to be weakened or
	abandoned, and makes his Perception + Well of Knowledge roll, as above.
	¥¥ The mutant can draw six dots of abilities.
	¥¥¥ Nine dots.
	¥¥¥¥ Twelve dots.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Fifteen dots.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Reckoning- the mutant may look at a person and determine, with a
	Perception + Well of Knowledge roll (diff 6 + the person's Rank in any
	Power that offers psychic or empathic defenses) what abilities she has
	in the mutant's category, and how skilled she is in their use.
	¥¥¥ With Great Power- the mutant may attempt to draw superhuman levels
	of an ability (i.e., increase it to six or more points).  This
	increases the difficulty of the roll by three.  Exotic abilities can
	not be drawn in this way.  At Rank three, the maximum Rank in an
	ability is six; this increases by one per Rank in this Power.  That is,
	if the mutant has five Ranks of Well of Knowledge, he can increase an
	ability to eight.  If there is no one connected to the collective
	unconscious who has a high enough score in that ability, it can not be
	so improved.
	¥¥¥¥ All Round- the mutant may develop another variation of this Power
	(either Talents, Skills, or Knowledges) with Experience.

	If a particular ability is not in the collective unconscious, it is not
	accessible by this Power.  Vampires, aliens, and gods are not connected
	to the collective unconscious, for example, and their abilities can not
	be imitated.

	Variant: Database- the mutant can access stored data instead of the
	human collective unconscious.  It is difficulty 6 to draw from the
	internet, diff 7 for digital media not connected to internet, diff 8
	for magnetic storage media (diskettes, video tapes), diff 9 for printed
	media and CDs.  The number of successes required to access information
	is up to the storyteller.  For local media, the range of this Power is
	touch.  The system is Perception + Database.  This Variant does not
	involve the use or augmentation of abilities, but can lead to knowledge
	which will justify the further development of an ability with
	Experience.

	¥¥ The mutant can draw and interpret encoded information, from web
	sites to books.  Foreign language content, while it may be impossible
	to interpret for the mutant by ear or visual inspection, is
	automatically decoded for her at a touch.  Alien information tech. may
	be interpreted this way at +2 difficulty.

Wings (Physical) [PN]
	Your mutant, like Angel of the X-Men, has a set of wings which are
	capable of bearing his weight in flight.  This is a nice advantage,
	to be sure- since you will be able to make quick getaways and go
	places that other people can't.  There are any number of possible uses
	for Wings.  Flying is about as taxing as jogging at stall speed,
	walking at 2/3 top speed, or running at top speed.  The mutant cannot
	bear his own weight at less than stall speed, and will fall unless he
	has the Power Stunt: Hover. The mutant must purchase the Skill: Flight.
	
	Variation: Arm-Wings- Your mutant has not grown an extra set of wings,
	but rather his arms have been altered to include the webbing or feathers
	that compose the wings.  This variation gives you 2 Freebie points back
	after initial purchase.
	
	Special Flaw: Hollow Bones (3-point Flaw)- the mutant may increase his
	top flight speed by 50%, because he has hollow bones.  However, all of
	his soak rolls against blunt force damage (including brawling) are at
	a +1 difficulty.
	
	Special Merit: Powerful (6-point Merit)- the mutant's wings are so
	strong that they are the equivalent of Body Weaponry of one Rank less
	than his Wings (Rank one Wings are still a Str + 1 weapon)
	
	¥ The mutant can move at speeds of up to 30 km/h, and has a stall speed
	of 15 km/h.  The mutant's powerful wings can be used as a Str + 1
	weapon (Dex + Brawl).
	¥¥ The mutant can fly at speeds of up to 60 km/h, and has a stall speed
	of 15 km/h.
	¥¥¥ The mutant can fly at speeds of up to 100 km/h, and has a stall
	speed of 15 km/h.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant can fly at speeds of up to 150 km/h, and has a stall
	speed of 10 km/h.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant can fly at speeds of up to 200 km/h, and has a stall
	speed of 10 km/h.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant can fly at speeds of up to 300 km/h, and can hover
	with ease.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Dive- the character can fly up very high and then gain speed by tucking
	in his wings and falling straight downward, pulling up at the last second.
	This can be combined with a weapons attack for devastating effects.
	Require a Dex + Flight roll (diff 7).
	¥ Rarefied Air- the mutant has the ability to breathe in environments
	which have less air than normal- on mountaintops and the like.
	¥¥ Hover- The mutant can fly in place, like a hummingbird.  This is just
	as taxing as flying at full speed.

Word of Recall (Social) [AL]
	A magical Power that allows the mutant in question to either teleport
	or apport in an instant, by saying a Word of power that creates a link
	between two locations.  This is not quite the same as teleportation,
	because its range is unlimited, but it requires preparation.  First,
	the mutant either inscribes the Word onto an object somewhere in a
	place.  The physical form of the inscription need not be permanent; it
	can be as simple as speaking the Word aloud in a place, or whispering
	it to the object. It can also take the form of writing the Word, using
	any medium.  When the mutant either wants to apport the object or
	teleport to the place, he needs only speak the Word and invoke this
	Power (Charisma + Word of Recall, diff 4).
	
	Special Flaw: Permanent Inscription-- once inscribed, a Word does not
	change its target unless it (the person or object inscribed) is utterly
	destroyed.

	¥ The mutant knows one Word, which is reusable (he must simply
	uninscribe an object or place in order that he might use it in a new
	place).  The mutant (or the object) will travel across any amount of
	space, or even dimensions (though not time) to reach the destination.
	Objects subject to apportation may be no heavier than the mutant can
	lift.
	¥¥ The mutant knows two Words.
	¥¥¥ The mutant knows three Words.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant knows four Words.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant knows five Words.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Teleport Other- the mutant may whisper the Word to a person (who
	will not be able to remember it) either to inscribe him for
	apportation, or (in conjunction with the Third Party stunt) to send
	him to an inscribed location.  The person need not understand the
	Word, so anything that can hear is eligible for use with this Stunt.
	¥¥¥ Third Party- the mutant may use the Word to send an object to
	a location, rather than involve himself.  This must always be an
	object he has to hand, and a location that he has inscribed.
	¥¥¥¥ Reverse Apportation- the mutant may elect to bring himself to
	an object, rather than call an object to hand, with this Stunt.
	¥¥¥¥ Relocation- the mutant may send an object to a location without
	even being near either of them.  Both the object and the location have
	to have been inscribed.  Requires the Stunt: Third Party.
	
	Word of Recall/Duplication Combination Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥ Remote Activation- the mutant can make a duplicate appear in a remote
	location (guided by an inscribed word on an item, person, or location)
	instead of appearing beside the mutant.
	¥¥¥¥/¥ Substitution- the mutant can concentrate to change places with
	an inscribed person or item, or to switch a duplicate with the
	inscribed person or item.  Requires the Stunts: Third Party, Reverse
	Apportation, Relocation, Remote Activation.  Does not work with the
	Illusory Duplicates variation.  Roll Wits + Word of Recall, diff 6 +
	the range (as Ranks of Teleportation).

Xenophysiology (Physical) [PN]
	Although mutants are certainly human, and can breed true with normal
	homo sapiens sapiens, some of them apparently have the ability to breed
	with certain anthromorphic aliens, as well.  Children of such unions may
	have some... unusual physical characteristics.  Captain Marvel and Adam X
	have this distinction, being half-Kree and half-Shi'ar, respectively.
	The normal Powers found in this guide can simulate the Powers associated
	with the alien race (Shapeshifting might come with being a half-Skrull,
	for instance) which are purchased normally, but it also has some other
	advantages.  No roll is normally required.

	* Biomanipulation is at +2 difficulty to affect the mutant.
	* Telepathic attacks and domination are at +2 difficulty to affect 
	the mutant.
	* The Powers associated with the alien part of the mutant's parentage
	may be bought with Experience points, even if the mutant did not start
	with those powers.
	* The mutant may purchase immunity to individual diseases and poisons
	as Power Stunts.
	* The mutant may take the Equipment Background at half cost (alien
	technology).

	¥¥ The character is half-alien by birth.  One Attribute category may be
	subject to improvement to six dots with Experience or freebie points.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥ Poison resistance- the mutant is not affected by one particular 
	hazardous substance.
	¥¥ Disease resistance- the mutant is not affected by one particular
	disease.

X-Factoring (Mental) [AL]
	The Mad Thinker does not have precognition; he is merely extremely
	good at predicting the behavior of others.  Domino's ex-husband,
	Milo Thurman, also could make a good bet when he saw the opportunity.
	This Power allows the mutant to predict such things as the outcomes
	of lotteries, the actions of others, and even simple random chance-
	to the point that it almost appears that he is controlling events.
	If there would be any roll required, it would be Perception +
	X-Factoring, difficulty of the opposing character's Intelligence +
	Manipulation.

	¥ The mutant always declares his action last in any round, without
	regard to his initiative roll.
	¥¥ The mutant can make a Dodge roll against any attack, including
	attacks from behind.
	¥¥¥ The mutant (player) can always be assumed to have that tiny piece
	of equipment needed for a particular task (lock picks, bank card, rope,
	etc.) which comes up 'unexpectedly'.
	¥¥¥¥ The mutant gets to make a Dodge roll without splitting his dice
	pool (up to 3 attacks per round may be dodged in this way)
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant may force one die per roll on the table to be
	re-rolled- his dice, another player's, or even the ST's.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The mutant may increase or decrease each character's initiative
	difficulty by up to his own Wits score (max of 10, minimum of 2)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Any one character's botch or re-roll range may be increased by
	one each round.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ The mutant may always roll with punches or falls (adding 
	his Dodge score to all soak rolls).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ The mutant may spend Willpower to nullify another character's
	successes (including auto-successes).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant may widen each character's botch or re-roll range
	by up to two.

Yang Channeling (Social) [AN]
	The Yang is aggressive energy, the force of immediate action.  It is
	kinetic and sudden.  The mutant channels this energy in order to
	succeed in his endeavors.
	
	¥ The mutant adds one die to all Strength, Athletics, Intimidation,
	Acrobatics, Rage, and Fast-Draw pools.  This does not accumulate
	(so a Strength + Acrobatics roll would receive only one die at this
	Rank).
	¥¥ Two dice.
	¥¥¥ Three dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Air Pulse- the mutant may elect to forgo damage rolls for Brawl,
	Martial Arts, or Melee combat, instead inflicting his Rank in Yang
	Channeling as damage.
	¥¥¥ Fire Pulse- the mutant recovers Power Charge at double the normal
	rate.
	¥¥¥¥ Intensity- the mutant receives two automatic successes when he
	spends a point of Willpower, rather than one.
	¥¥¥¥ Metal Pulse- all damage that the mutant delivers is aggravated.

Yclepsis* (Social) [AL]
	The power of naming is the Power of Yclepsis, and it has a long and
	rich history.  In modern times, it is all but unknown, and most people
	go by their true names.  This allows a mutant with this Power to gain
	control over them in a way that it was difficult to do in the past. 
	Few mutants (notably Wolverine, Shatterstar, and Magneto) could claim
	to have any protection from this ability.  The mutant who has this
	Power spends a point of Willpower and then rolls Charisma + Yclepsis
	(diff of the opposing mutant's Willpower) and the effects of the
	naming usually last one scene per success.  If the opposing mutant has
	the Power: Iron Will, the mutant with Yclepsis must gain a number of
	successes on this roll equal to the opposing mutant's Iron Will + 1 to
	have any effect at all.  The victim must be able to hear the mutant
	speak the name for this Power to function.
	
	¥ Block- the victim cannot attack the Namer for the duration of the
	effect.
	¥¥ Command- the victim is subject to one command per round, up to the
	number of successes achieved on the roll.  These can be resisted with
	a Willpower check (difficulty varies with the repugnance of the
	order).  Suicidal orders are automatically resisted.
	¥¥¥ Curse- the victim can be cursed with bad luck as per Rank two
	Hex Power; this curse lasts one week per success, and the mishaps crop
	up erratically throughout the entire period.
	¥¥¥¥ Nullification- all active Powers are completely nullified for the
	duration of the effect, regardless of the Rank of these Powers.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Death- the victim takes one Health Level of damage per success;
	this can be soaked normally.  This ability cannot be used when any
	other Yclepsis effect is working on the victim.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Kill Switch- the victim loses consciousness for the duration of
	the effect; she can be awakened manually after one round/success.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Youth's Bane- the victim can be cursed with any disease that
	the mutant knows the true name of (thus, he needs to know two names
	to use this Rank-- that of the victim, and that of the disease).
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Heart's Name- the mutant may now use Yclepsis against the
	individual parts of a person's body.  These parts each have a secret,
	true name (all hearts, for instance, have the same name) and the
	mutant can use the abilities above against it.  Kill Switching a heart
	is usually lethal.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Bury the Name- the mutant may excise herself from the memory
	of every person on earth; there is no defense against this apart from
	Iron Will, which will allow a person a diff 9 Intelligence + Area
	Knowledge roll to remember the namer when next they meet.  The number
	of successes required on such a recollection roll is 6 minus the
	person's Rank in Iron Will.  Use of this ability requires the
	expenditure of a point of permanent Willpower.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Erase the Name- the mutant may destroy her True Name.  This
	makes it impossible to touch her with any form of magic, detection
	ability, coercive ability, or Yclepsis itself.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Distant speech- the mutant hears what is said for the next ten
	seconds whenever his true name is spoken anywhere on Earth.

Yesterscape (Mental) [AL]
	This is an extremely specialized form of Precognition that allows
	the mutant to 'dip into' tomorrow's collective memories of today.
	That is, the mutant has access to a database of the collective
	experience of every human being that is alive today and will be
	alive tomorrow.  In essence, the mutant is walking through an
	eternal yesterday.  The problem, of course, is trying to narrow the
	focus of the mutant's attention enough to get something useful
	out of it.  At the end of the day, the 'database' is erased and
	replaced with the events of the next day.  No mutant with Yesterscape
	may concentrate on his own memories because they exist outside of
	the collective unconscious.  Monet St. Croix may have a Power similar
	to this one.  A person who is scanned will know that it is happening.
	Roll Perception + Yesterscape (diff 8).
	
	¥ The mutant can concentrate and learn haphazard details about
	specific events.  He may not concentrate on one person (or at least,
	may not do so successfully).
	¥¥ People who the mutant touches may be scanned with this Power
	to find out what they will remember of the day.  This can be
	protected against with any form of psychic defense.  This is a
	Willpower check, difficulty varies with the willingness of the
	subject and how well the mutant knows the subject.  Details will
	be sketchy and hazy, at best.
	¥¥¥ People who the mutant touches may be scanned, as well as
	intimates of the mutant (family, close friends).  A few specific
	insights may be gleaned.
	¥¥¥¥ People who the mutant can see clearly may be scanned, as
	well as people who intimates of the mutant know intimately.
	(The mutant can touch his intimate and use their relationship
	as a piggy-back ride to the other person).  The memories will be
	fairly clear with a close relationship, but the less well the
	mutant knows the subject, the hazier the information will get.
	¥¥¥¥¥ People who the mutant can see clearly may be scanned,
	as well as any intimates of those people, if he touches them
	(as Rank Four).  The memories of those he knows well will be
	as clear as if they were his own- other people's memories will
	get more hazy with remoteness.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥¥ Remote- because the mutant is removed from the collective
	unconscious, he is difficult to affect with psychic abilities.
	The mutant may purchase Psychic Defense with Experience points,
	even if he did not start the game with that Power.

Yin Channeling (Social) [AN]
	The Yin is receptive and female energy, but no less effective than its
	Yang counterpart for all that.  Half of all of the energy in the
	universe is potential, or receptive, and that is the energy that this
	Power uses in order to protect the mutant.
	
	¥ One die may be added to all Alertness, Dodge, Empathy, Intuition,
	Subterfuge, Stealth, Survival, or Stamina Dice Pools.  This does not
	accumulate (so a Stamina + Survival pool would only receive one extra
	die at this Rank).
	¥¥ Two dice.
	¥¥¥ Three dice.
	¥¥¥¥ Four dice.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five dice.

	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Yado- the mutant may purchase the Talent: Yadomejutsu (missile
	deflection).  See Martial Arts Supremacy for the description.
	¥¥ Roll with Blow- the mutant may roll Stamina + Dodge to soak
	an attack if she can move.
	¥¥¥ Air Pulse- requires the Stunt: Yado.  The mutant may redirect
	missile or melee attacks onto adjacent victims with a successful
	Yado roll.
	¥¥¥ Water Pulse- the mutant may elect to forgo dodging or soaking
	and ignore her Rank in damage per successful hit against her.
	¥¥¥¥ Earth Pulse- the mutant's understanding of her surroundings
	is intuitive; she may force her opponent to make an Athletics or
	Perception check every round (at the cost of a +1 difficulty to
	all her other actions).  If the opponent fails, he stumbles, 
	runs into a stationary object, or otherwise fouls himself (a +2
	difficulty penalty for failure, or loss of action for a botch).
	This does not affect mutants with the Power: Free Action.

Zenjoriki (Mental) [AL]
	The arts of invisibility, legendary discipline of the ninja, have
	become second nature to a mutant with this Power.  Although it assumes
	a fluid grace and high Dexterity, the heart of Zenjoriki is actually in
	the mental focus that it requires.  The mutant adds his Zenjoriki score
	to all Stealth dice pools, so any roll involving this Power will be a
	stealth roll.
	
	¥ The mutant adds his Rank in Zenjoriki to all Stealth pools. 
	Superhuman levels of quiet are possible in this case.  Mutants with
	Heightened Senses do not have a reduced difficulty to detect the sneak
	with their hearing.
	¥¥ The mutant is also scentless, capable of defeating dogs or other
	beings with a super-human sense of smell.  Additionally, he is capable
	of hiding in the smallest depressions and behind objects that others
	would swear could never conceal a full-grown man.  He can't hide behind
	a mouse or Lego brick, mind you.
	¥¥¥ The capability of hiding in plain sight comes at this Rank.  Even
	if others are looking right at him, the mutant can make a diversion 
	and hide with a Manipulation + Stealth roll (difficulty of the 
	opponents' Perception + Alertness, max 10).  There must be some cover,
	even if it is only another person to hide behind.
	¥¥¥¥ A keen understanding of human observation patterns allows the
	mutant to perform the 'just out of sight' trick, which requires an
	initial five successes on a dice roll.  He may hide right behind,
	beside, in front of someone, moving as they move, keeping just out of
	their visual fields and so remaining undetected, even in a wasteland.
	This is a Wits + Stealth roll, diff of the opponent's Perception and
	Alertness.  It is very difficult against two people; in addition to the
	difficulty of hiding from the most perceptive of the two, each person
	gets to roll Perception + Alertness (diff of the mutant's Wits +
	Zenjoriki), and their combined score is the minimum number of successes
	that the mutant needs to stay hidden from both (minimum of one success,
	even if they both manage to botch).  If there are three people, the
	same principle applies.
	¥¥¥¥¥ The mutant's step is so light that he is practically traceless.
	He runs across the top of snow, does not disturb dust, never makes a
	ripple when rising from water.  The mutant subtracts his Rank from
	the Tracking successes of those trying to follow him.
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Art of Disguise- the mutant knows how to act unobtrusive, and may
	add his rank in Zenjoriki to his Disguise dice pools, as well.
	¥¥ Intuition- purchase up to two points of Intuition with Experience.
	¥¥ Palming- any fine control rolls involving theft in plain sight
	(using redirection of attention and/or pickpocketing) can be augmented
	by the mutant's Zenjoriki score.
	¥¥¥ Conceal object- even while being frisked, the mutant can twitch
	muscles and smoothly move when the searcher is looking elsewhere,
	passing an object to different parts of his body so that it is never
	discovered (Wits + Stealth, diff. 8)
	¥¥¥ Spot Hidden- the ninja, familiar as he is with the art of moving
	silently, can spot the earmarks of the same.  He automatically gets
	a Perception + Stealth roll to spot people hiding, or to notice the
	tiny mistakes of people sneaking up on him.  The difficulty is the
	opponent's Wits + Stealth, and only one success is required.
	¥¥¥¥ Ride herd- if the mutant has the Ventriloquism Skill, he may
	(through strategic misdirection) help hapless comrades by rolling
	Intelligence + Ventriloquism to draw the attention of listeners away at
	critical moments.  He then rolls his Rank in Zenjoriki (diff 6), and
	his successes are substituted for any failures or less proficient rolls
	that other people might have made (other than botches).
	¥¥¥¥¥ Indetectibility to machines- the mutant may purchase this
	Power with Experience.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Telepathic invisibility- an old element of Zenjoriki that few
	ever attain.  The mutant may purchase this Power with Experience.

Zenotic Space* (Physical/Mental) [AL]
	The Eliatic philosopher Zeno probably didn't have this Power in mind
	when he spoke on time and space, but perhaps someone with this Power
	was listening to him in Zenotic Space as he said those things.  This
	Power entails the ability to create an extra-dimensional space in
	which time is observed to pass, but no time passes in the outside
	world (that is, it is composed of space that is divisible with
	limits, in which the smallest conceivable unit has no size, and of
	time ruled by similar considerations).  No end of uses for this one.
	If any rolls would be made for this Power, they would probably
	be Stamina checks (for shock).  Perception + Zenotic Space checks
	are also possible.
	
	Variation: Mental Space (Mental) [AH]- the mutant's body does not move
	into any sort of extradimensional space, but the mind can take all the
	"time" it needs.  How the mutant experiences it may vary; some might
	seem to be in their bodies, frozen in time, and others might be in a
	little mindscape.  No time passes from the moment the mutant activates
	this Power to the time when it's released.  This variation is not
	double cost.

	¥ The mutant can move into this Zenotic space, which may have any
	particular physical attributes that he can imagine (including a
	comfortable couch, etc.)- none of which can be removed from the space,
	unfortunately.  Its (apparent) size is roughly equivalent to the
	mutant's Intelligence + Wits x 10 square metres.  Only the mutant can
	enter this space, where he can spend any amount of "time" that he
	wants.
	¥¥ The mutant can allow one other person to enter his Zenotic Space,
	and this person can also enjoy the benefits thereof.  The size of the
	space is still solely dependent on the mutant himself.
	¥¥¥ Up to three people can enter the space.  The mutant can now decide
	that the Zenotic Space will open someplace else- other than the place
	where he originally opened the door.  The range of this is conceptual-
	anyplace that the mutant has been, or can conceive of accurately enough
	that the place exists as conceived.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to five people can enter the space.  The space itself can be
	reconfigured as an act of will.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to ten people can enter the space.  The mutant can now
	actively engage in 'time dilation' effects which will allow time inside
	to pass at a rate roughly analogous to the time outside (so time could
	apparently be passing four times as slowly outside, for instance,
	rather than not at all).
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥¥/¥ Conference- Requires the Power: Psionic Collective.  The members
	of a Psionic Collective can merge their Zenotic Spaces into a bigger
	one, but only while they are in the Collective.  If one drops out from
	the Collective, that person's Zenotic Space is separated from the rest.
	¥¥ Dump- the mutant may eject all of the real objects currently within
	the space (sentient or non-) without entering it.  This requires a
	Manipulation + Zenotic Space (diff 6).
	¥¥ Store- the mutant can keep real, physical belongings inside the 
	Space, even when he is not there.  So long as the objects are not self-
	aware, this requires no concentration.
	¥¥¥¥ Space Trap- with a Manipulation + Zenotic Space roll (diff of
	the opposing person's Wits + Dodge) the mutant can trap a victim in
	her Zenotic Space.  The victim may be trapped indefinitely, but this
	requires some concentration on the part of the mutant for as long as
	it lasts (remove one die from all low concentration pools and halve
	all high concentration pools).  The mutant controls the passage of
	time for the victim while he is trapped in the Zenotic Space.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Realize [AH]- the mutant's Zenotic Space merges with the physical
	world, taking up the appropriate amount of space.  The time effects of
	the space do not function while it is realized.  Any objects that were
	in the space may be interacted with, including 'virtual' objects 
	(though these cannot be removed).  When the mutant chooses to uncouple
	the Zenotic Space from real space, any persons or objects within the
	area may be taken into the Space if the mutant desires (up to the
	maximum number for his Rank) or excluded.  'Virtual' objects so
	excluded will instantly vanish.  Keeping the Zenotic Space attached
	to real space requires heavy concentration, and  needs a Perception
	+ Zenotic Space roll (diff 8), both to realize the space and to
	return it to its regular state.

Zoophysiology (Physical) [PN]
	Just as with the Power: Xenophysiology, there are many variations of
	Zoophysiology.  Basically, the mutant's body changed when his Powers
	manifested to take on some of the attributes of some kind of animal,
	including reptiles, amphibians, birds, fish, or even insects.  Though
	he looks human, Spider-man has Zoophysiology (Spider).  There are a
	number of possible traits that would go along with Zoophysiology:
	
	* Reptilian mutants may have scaly armour, cold blood, etc.  They might
	not have to eat very often, may have a jaw like a snake (open wide!),
	and may be able to push his internal organs around with his muscles. 
	Any trait that a reptile has, a mutant with Zoophysiology might have.
	* Avian mutants may have heightened reflexes, extremely powerful arms
	and legs, hollow bones, wings, a fast metabolism, etc.  They may even
	lay eggs!
	* Insectoid mutants may have weird body weaponry and body armour,
	wings, extra legs, no heart, extra eyes, webspinning or poison,
	communication via chemicals, immense Strength, etc.
	* Icthyoid mutants may have scaly armour, cold blood, eyes that are
	angled to see from two different directions, gills, webbed feet and
	hands, etc.
	* Amphibious mutants may have scaly armour, cold blood, a tongue like a
	frog, wallcrawling abilities, hyper-leaping, etc.
	
	The collateral powers for any particular Zoophysiological mutant cost
	two Freebie or Experience points less than normal per Rank. Any Powers
	that the 'sponsoring' creature has may be bought with Experience
	points.  Physiological changes like cold blood or an unhinged jaw are
	not separate Powers, and come free.  No roll is required.
	
	* Telepathy is at +1 difficulty to affect the mutant.  On the other
	hand, Animal Telepathy (diff +3) may be used against the mutant!
	* Biomanipulation is at +1 difficulty to affect the mutant.
	* The mutant does not smell human, and will not disturb animals (unless
	he took Zoophysiology (Wolf)!) the way that humans will.
	* The mutant has an automatic Animal Ken of 2 when dealing with animals
	of his type.
	* Unless you become evil, you will smell slightly of the Wyld to
	werewolves (rather than the Weaver- see Werewolf: The Apocalypse if
	this matters to you) and will get a -1 difficulty to all social rolls
	with werewolves.
	* All Extra Body Parts that could be associated with this animal type
	cost only one Rank in initial purchase.
	
	¥ The mutant has the physiology of an animal of some kind.  Weird!
	
	Sample Power Stunts:
	¥ Animal Telepathy*- the mutant may buy a variant of Animal TP that
	allows him to speak to the animals of his 'type' (see the Animal
	Telepathy listing for cost) only, with Experience points.
	¥ Temperature Control- the mutant has some control over his body
	temperature, if he is cold blooded.  A Stamina + Zoophysiology roll
	(difficulty varying with the extremity of the temperature-- base 7)
	allows him to adjust his internal temperature upward in cold conditions
	(to a temperature no higher than 15 or 20 degrees Celsius).  This stunt
	does not allow the mutant to lower his temperature in uncomfortably
	warm conditions.
	¥ Understanding- the mutant has -3 difficulties to all Animal Ken rolls
	featuring the animals of his 'type'.

						MERITS AND FLAWS FOR MUTANTS
						

While many Merits and Flaws from the various Player's Guides also apply
to mutants, there are a few that are unique to them.

¥ Askani Training (7 point Merit)- like Cable, you have had intensive
training by the Askani sisterhood and extensive war experience.  The
sisterhood's far in the future, guys, so it's not the easiest thing to
get.  This merit allows the purchase of the Powers: Meditative Focus and
Iron Will with Experience points.  It also allows the purchase of the
Askani Martial Art (the Martial Arts Skill) at half cost, the Theology
Knowledge at half cost, and Willpower at half cost (this last for 
Experience purchase only).

¥ Backlash (1-3 point Flaw)- Your body does not handle the use of one or
more of your Powers very well, and this becomes evident whenever you use
it.  The form of the backlash that you suffer varies, but it's typically
related to the Power.  Use of Matter Body (Stone) might cause stiffness
(increasing Dexterity difficulties by one).  Use of Hyper-Speed might cause
dizziness and disorientation (increasing difficulties for all mental
actions, such as initiative, by one).  Use of Energy Emission (Fire) might
inflict burns on the hands, causing a Health Level of damage.  The value of
the Flaw depends on when the penalties accrue.  For one point, the backlash
occurs once you've stopped using the Power-- at the end of combat, for
example.  For two points, the backlash occurs while you're using the Power,
but the effects do not continue afterward.  For three points, the backlash
occurs while you're using the Power, and continue after you've stopped.
One- or two- point backlash effects can last, at the most, for a scene.
Three point backlash effects can last for as long as a day.

In the case of direct reduction effects (damage to Health or loss of
Willpower), the effects last as long as they normally would-- until the
body heals, for example.  A one-point backlash of this nature would assess
one point of lost Willpower or Health at the end of the combat/scene, no
matter how many times the Power was used.  A two-point backlash would
assess the point loss when the Power was first activated in the scene.  A
three-point backlash would assess a point loss both at the activation and
at the end of the combat/scene.

¥ Brain Box (4 point Flaw)- Cyberdata (of the Top Cow universe) is fond of
using cybernetic implants in a subject's brain to simulate memory implants.
This functions in all respects as the flaw: Memory Implants (5 pts) save
that it can be more easily nullified. On the upside, this Flaw allows the
mutant to purchase the Power: Psychic Defense with Experience points.

¥ Charged Up (4 point Merit)- You regain Power Charge at a rate of one
point per hour of total rest, in addition to the regular rate of one point
per day.  This is cumulative with Accelerated Recovery, if you have that
Power.

¥ Chaste Training (6 point Merit)- The Chaste are a group of reclusive
martial artist monks headed by the mysterious spirit Stick.  They have a
small membership, but such better-known luminaries as Daredevil have
received this training.  There are a number of advantages to this.

First, the mutant may increase Brawl, Martial Arts, Meditation, and
Acrobatics above five points with Experience or Freebie points.  It also
allows the mutant to purchase the Power: Iron Will with Experience.

¥ Coda Training (4 or 7 point Merit)- The Coda is an elite group of female
warriors founded by Zealot in the Wildstorm universe. It has a unique
fighting style and a number of special mystical exercises that help bring
out characteristics that are latent in normal humans.

For four points, the character has received partial training, learning only
the fighting style of the Coda. Most men can only achieve this level of
Coda training; in fact, only one man ever completed the Coda training.  At
any rate, this allows the character to raise his Brawl and Melee scores
above five points with Experience or Freebie points.

For seven points, the character can purchase the following Powers with
experience (through performance and practice of regular exercises, or by
learning them through a Coda teacher):

	Altered Perceptions (Heightened Senses)
	Conditional Immortality- the character will not age.
	Detection (Danger Sense)
	Heightened Reflexes

¥ Conditional Recharge (1 or 2 point Flaw)- You don't regain Power Charge
automatically.  Instead (for one point) you must have fulfilled your
Nature or Demeanor such that you would receive Willpower (regaining one
point of Charge instead; it does not come immediately, but at the beginning
of the following day).  For two points, a specific condition (such as
having perfect health, being drunk, having taken a Health Level of damage
from fire, etc.) must be met before Power Charge can be regenerated.  It
returns in the same wise as for the one-point condition.  The Storyteller
may rule out conditions at her discretion.  See also the Undercharged
Flaw.

¥ Dedicated Hatred (3-6 point Merit)- The mutant lives to hunt and destroy
a particular enemy, be it Sentinels, Hydra agents, members of the
Brotherhood, or what have you.  In any case, the mutant's re-roll range
when directly opposing this thing she hates (in combat, etc.-- the thing
has to be present for the bonus to accrue) is increased by one.  That is,
in most cases, the mutant will re-roll any die that comes up nine or ten.
For three points, the enemy is a single person (like Magneto), probably a
very powerful one.  For four points, this merit would apply to that person
and his most direct minions (for example, Magneto and his lieutenant du
jour, or Apocalypse and his Horsemen).  For five points, the enemy can be
quite a large group (such as all Sentinels, all Hydra agents, all members
of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants).  For six points, the enemy can be a
large group and its clear sympathizers.  Note that the mutant is not
eligible to take this person or group as an Enemy flaw.

¥ Dormant Power (1-5 point Flaw)- One of the mutant's powers is dormant- he
or she cannot activate it on purpose, and it will only function when the
Storyteller wants it to, if at all.  This Flaw can be bought off with
Experience Points.  The value of the Flaw is equal to the dormant Power's
Rank.

¥ Draining Power (4 point Flaw)- the use of one of your Active Powers
requires the expenditure of a point of Power Charge at the start of the
round.

¥ Elite Military Training (4 point Merit)- the Navy Seals, Mossad agents,
the X.S.E., and the Black Razors all have the most intensive possible
military/police training, and with this Merit, so does your mutant!  The
following  Abilities may be bought with Experience or Freebie points for
half cost: Alertness, Brawl, Firearms, Melee, Stealth, Survival, and one of
Blindfighting, Climbing, Heavy Weapons, Intuition, Military/Intelligence
Lore, or Swimming.  This Merit allows the character to purchase the Talent:
Intuition, though he cannot improve it above Rank one.

¥ Empathic Link (2 point Flaw)- This flaw ties one of your Powers strongly
to your character's emotional state. The Power must be one that can be
activated; not a passive power like Wolverine's claws or the Beast's
agility.  Like Storm of the X-Men, you may find that you must keep your
feelings reined in to stay in control.

If the character becomes very agitated or upset (player or ST's option),
the Power will kick in- a Willpower check (difficulty 6) is required to
keep it under control. For every success scored on this roll, the effective
Rank of the effect that leaks out (for instance, a mutant with Energy
Emission (Flame) might start spurting flames from his hands) will be
reduced by one from the maximum. Thus, a mutant with a Rank three Power who
scores only one success on his Willpower roll will find that his Power has
kicked in at an effective Rank two level. If the Power has a fixed Rank
(like Mass Shifting (Decrease) does) then decrease the effect as possible
with successes, or simply rule that the mutant requires the full range of
successes to dampen the Power (in this case, 4).

The affected Power will be augmented in certain ways, as follows:
  a) Whenever the mutant botches his Willpower check to control himself,
  the effective Rank of the Power's effect increases to his Power
  Potential.
  b) If the mutant has Rage, he can spend a point of Rage to increase the
  Rank of his Power for one attack, but he must make a Frenzy check each
  time he does so, whether or not he has the Frenzy stunt.
  c) If the mutant enters a Frenzy, he uses his Power for attack each
  round, if possible, at the maximum level normally allowed by his Rank.
  This is one of the few cases in which the mutant can use a Power while in
  a Frenzy.
  d) If the character is attacked by an Empath, the difficulty for his
  control roll increases by the attacker's Rank in Empathy.

¥ Family Rivalry (2 point Merit)- If you have family members that are also
mutants, you are immune to their powers.  However, they can take this Merit
also and be immune to yours!

¥ Hidden Power (5 point Merit)- the mutant has a power that he or she does
not even know about, but will be revealed in due time.  The Storyteller
gets to pick the power.

¥ Involuntary Power (2 to 4 point Flaw)- One of the mutant's powers is on
all the time and cannot be shut off or controlled.  Rogue's absorption
powers and Cyclops' eye beams are like this, and both mutants suffer for
it.  The amount of the Flaw depends on how much of an inconvenience it is.
To Rogue (who can't touch anyone), it's huge.

¥ Legacy Virus (5 point Flaw)- Your character has contracted the deadly
Legacy Virus, which will slowly unravel your powers and kill you.  The
effects are debilitating, and your powers may soon go haywire, out of your
control.  There is no cure, campers.

¥ L L & L Bank Account (3 point Merit)- Your character invests his money
with Landau, Luckman, and Lake.  This requires the Background: Resources.
He cannot be deprived of his money by government fiat, tricksy computer
work, or stock market collapse.  Furthermore, due to the interdimensional
cross- time sneaky investment strategies that LL&L employs, the monthly
allowance of the character is treated as if his Resources were one point
higher- if he has Resources 5, it doubles.

¥ Memory Implants (3 or 5 point Flaw)- Often associated with the Nightmares
flaw. Not all of your memories are true- they have been implanted by
someone who is not looking out for your best interests.  A three-point Flaw
is a simple group of false memories.  These are not detectible as false by
telepathy.  A five- point Flaw is worse- it contains triggers (imperatives)
which may be set off in a variety of ways to force you to do something. You
may or may not be conscious of what is happening when a command has been
triggered.

¥ Molting (3 or 4 point Flaw)- Whenever a mutant with the three-point
version of Molting increases the Rank of a Power, or buys a new Power, his
body undergoes some painful and debilitating changes in order to accommodate
the new abilities. This results in heavy dice penalties (-3 to -5) to the
mutant for as long as the mutant is molting- typically two days per Rank,
or one week for a new Power. The four-point version will also involve a
molting period of one day per Rank when increasing Actual Power Level.

¥ Monstrous Appearance (2 or 4 point Flaw)- Your mutant does not have the
_minor_ physical changes commonly associated with the x-gene; he looks
absolutely alien.  For two points, the mutant cannot possibly be confused
with a normal human (the Beast, Leech, Spiral) and will suffer accordingly
(+2 diff to all social rolls with normal humans).  A 4-point version makes
you look positively hideous or fearsome (the Sugar Man, the Thing) and you
must cross the Appearance attribute off your character sheet.  All actions
that require Appearance automatically fail; you are just too ugly.

¥ Narrow Array (1-4 point Flaw)- the mutant has a seriously curtailed range
of action with one of her Powers.  At one point, she may only purchase 
Power Stunts at character creation.  For two points, she may only ever have
one Stunt.  For four points, the Power only functions as per the description
of one of the listed Power Stunts; she can not use the regular version of 
the Power as listed.  Note that she must have enough Ranks in the Power to
use the Stunt(s) that she chooses for this Flaw.  The Storyteller may 
disallow this Flaw for certain Powers.

¥ Ninja Clan Membership (5 point Merit)- You belong to a powerful family of
shadow warriors.  They may be the descendants of the Iga or Koga, or they
may be the Hand, or the Si-Fan, or any other such group.  In any case, the
mutant may purchase the Power: Zenjoriki at any time, and may also purchase
or improve the Background: Home Turf multiple times (for different
locales).  The cost for this in Experience is the same as for improving
Abilities.

¥ Overcharged (3 point Merit)- Although your permanent Power Charge begins
as equal to your Actual Power Level, you have a number of temporary points
over and above your regular score, to the limit of your Power Potential.
These can be spent or lost in the regular fashion, but do not regenerate.

¥ Painful Power (3 point Flaw)- Any time the mutant uses a particular
power, he suffers a -1 dice penalty for a number of rounds equal to the
Rank of that power.  A botch results in a Health Level of damage (soakable)
and a -2 penalty.

¥ Passive (7 point Merit)- one of your Active Powers, one that requires
either no concentration or light concentration, is Passive instead.  It
cannot be dampened or shut off by others, and it does not have to be
'dormed down' if you have the Dormancy Background.

¥ Power Active (3 point Flaw)- one of your passive Powers is Active
instead.  Thus, it can be dampened or shut off by others who have the
appropriate Powers.  Wings or Body Weaponry can disappear if you lose all
of your Power Charge.  This Flaw can not be taken with a Vampirism Power.

¥ Power Addiction (1-2 point Flaw)- The mutant is addicted to using one of
his Active powers, and gets a kick out of it. The power must be used for
some amount of time, and maybe for a non-significant act (like running with
hyper-speed). If the mutant fails to get his daily 'shot', he will get +1
dif on every roll, and +2 on every other powers roll.  The one-point
version of this Flaw affects Powers such as Hyper-Speed, Fire Control, etc.
while the two-point version affects Flesh Rot, Mind Disease, or Powers with
an expendable attribute like Gnosis.  The ST has final word on how many
points of this Flaw a Power is worth, or if it even qualifies.

¥ Power Focus (2-5 point Flaw)- one or more of your Powers requires that
you engage in an unusual behaviour to activate it.  This does not include
such things as pointing at a target to fire off an energy blast, but it may
involve such innocuous things as closing your eyes when using your
telepathy, or such dangerous actions as inflicting a Health Level of damage
on yourself when you use Karma Channeling.

If the effect is innocuous, it is worth one point.  Note that closing your
eyes may be harmless when using Telepathy, but it can be downright deadly
if you have to close your eyes to use Energy Emission.  Saying 'bang' when
using your Shadow Firearms is another example of this level.  Joe the Dead
has this level of Flaw.

If the effect is inconvenient or requires a prop, it is worth two points.
Having to be naked when using your Animal Telepathy, for instance, or
having to light a match to 'flame on' your Energy Body falls into this
category.  The Drummer has this level of Flaw.

If the effect is harmful or difficult, it is worth three points.  If it
takes an action (such as dancing a jig), or requires that you injure or
seriously risk injury to yourself (such as swallowing acid or stuffing your
shorts with scorpions) it is worth three points.

On the other axis, if this Flaw affects only one Power, it is worth one
more point.  If it affects all of your Powers, it is worth two points. When
measuring the inconvenience of the Flaw in the latter case, take the most
harmful value (the one worth more points).

Note that any behaviour or penalty that is specifically mentioned in a
Power description certainly does not qualify for use as the stimulus for
this Flaw.

¥ Power Natural (5 point Merit)- one of your Active Powers enjoys a
difficulty decrease of one point.

¥ Power Prerequisite (1 or 2 point Flaw)- Select an active Power.  You
cannot use this power within a scene before first using another (selected)
active Power first. For instance, if you link Energy Emission with Symbol
Evocation-- you cannot use Energy Emission until you use Symbol Evocation
at least once. For two points, the Power can only be used a single time
before it becomes dormant, and the linked Power must be used again to
reactivate it.

¥ Power Susceptibility (1-3 point Flaw)- One particular Power is your
mutant's bane.  For Iceman, it is Energy Emission (Fire).  Anyone who uses
this Power against your mutant enjoys a -1 difficulty to affect the mutant
with it.  For one point, this can be a rare power (Ossification, Energy
Emission (Nexus), or Health Proxy).  For two points, a more common power
(Telekinesis or Biomanipulation) can be chosen.  For three points, a power
as common as Energy Control (Fire) can be chosen.  The Storyteller decides
how many points a Power is worth.

¥ Power Traces (1 point Flaw)- One of the mutant's powers leaves some sort
of trace (like a smell, or a sound) that can make the mutant's presence
obvious or easy to track.  This trace is not under the mutant's control,
and cannot be overcome using normal means.

¥ Power Weakness (1-3 point Flaw)- This flaw either limits the possible
targets that one of your Powers can be used against or specifies a stimulus
that will negate the Power directly. For instance, the original Green
Lantern Ring could not be used against anything yellow. The Darkness'
creations are adversely affected by sunlight.  The more common the thing is
that your Power is weak against (and the more it limits the usefulness of
the Power), the more substantial the flaw.  For instance, a Power Weakness
that prevented a mutant from using her Biomanipulation against humans would
be a three point flaw, while an inability to run at Hyper-Speed in air that
is too polluted would be a two point flaw.  Something truly obscure, like
the inability to dampen blue light with Shadow Manipulation, would not be
worth any points at all.

¥ Registered Mutant (1 point Flaw)- under the old Mutant Registration
Act, your identity, powers, and location are under file by the US Gov't.
They have a rough idea of what you're capable of.

¥ Restricted Station (2 point Flaw)- one of the mutant's Social Powers
visibly comes from an organ or body area.  If that part is damaged or in
some way restrained, the mutant can not use the Power until the problem
is fixed.  If the part is destroyed, the mutant loses the Power.  Does
not apply to such Powers as Energy Body Parts, in which the power origin
is an innate part of the Power.

¥ Rigid Code of Ethics (2 point Flaw)- Describe a code of ethics that your
character must follow (such as a Surgeon's Hypocratic Oath or a Police
Officer's code of ethics).  This code of ethics is actually enforced by the
source of your character's powers (or perhaps, her subconscious) and if she
breaks any part of the code, she loses the use of all your powers from this
source until she "makes right" and repents (usually with an arduous quest
or some other sanction).  The Storyteller and player must agree to the
particulars of the code before this Flaw can be taken.

¥ School of Hard Knocks (7 point Merit)- Your character learns best when
things are beaten into him.  He gets an extra experience point in any game
session in which he is reduced to Crippled or Incapacitated by lethal or
aggravated damage.  Characters with Healing Factor or Accelerated Recovery
are not eligible for this Merit.

¥ Secondary Switch (5 point Merit)- one of the mutant's Tertiary Powers is
regarded as Secondary for all purposes (Freebie and Experience point costs,
eligibility for improvement, etc.)

¥ Silence (1 point Merit)- (from the Player's Guide to the Sabbat)- You
have an unusual ability to move quietly that goes far beyond the norm.
Reduce the difficulty on any Stealth roll involving quiet movement by two.

¥ Sporadic Control (1-3 point Flaw)- one of the mutant's Powers does not
work reliably.  For one point, the Power may occasionally operate as if it
were one or more Ranks lower (or, if the mutant intends to use the Power at
a lower level, it operates at maximum capacity).  This will happen at least
once per session, but no more than once per scene.  For two points, the
Power might stop functioning entirely, or activate when the mutant does not
intend it to.  This effect will happen no more frequently than once per
session, and operates in addition to the effects of the one point version. 
For three points, the mutant has no command of the Power at all, and it
operates when, if, and how the ST desires.  This Flaw cannot be applied to
all Powers; ST may rule that a particular application is not allowed.

¥ Supernatural Fingerprint (1 point Flaw)- you are detected as a mutant
by various abilities, such as Awareness, or the Gift: Sense the Unnatural,
and can be spotted with Kenning or Life Sight at -2 difficulty.

¥ Taxing Power (2 point Flaw)- One of the mutant's powers is very tiring,
and can only be used for a number of rounds equal to the mutant's Stamina
before the mutant must rest.  If he goes to the limit and does not rest, he
suffers a -1 dice penalty until he does.  Any further use of the power
without recharging has results similar to Painful Power, above (dice
penalties are cumulative).

¥ Undercharged (2 point Flaw)- You have difficulty regenerating Power
Charge. You must spend a point of Willpower each morning to restore your
daily point of Power Charge, if you are short one or more points.  You may
not take any Powers that allow you to restore Power Charge (such as
Accelerated Recovery or Charge Building).

¥ Weapon X Training (3-7 point Merit)- At some point in your life, you were
a part of, or associated with, the Weapon X program.  This gives you some
powerful ties and contacts (though they'll probably be indifferent or
negative if you don't take them as Contacts or Allies) in the mutant
community, and allows you to take the Adamantium Background.  You can also
increase one of Alertness, Athletics, Brawl, Dodge, Firearms, Missiles, or
Melee past level five with freebie points or experience.  For every point
above 3, you can increase another of these abilities above five. After all,
you were trained to be the best at what you do...  Wolverine, Domino,
Maverick, Wraith, Deadpool, Silver Fox, Sabretooth, Kane, and Flex have
this Merit.

¥ Also see the individual Power listings- some of them have special Flaws
that apply to them if you would like to take on their burden.


							BACKGROUNDS FOR MUTANTS

In addition to the special and modified backgrounds listed here, mutants
are eligible for the following Backgrounds: Allies, Clearance, Destiny,
Fame, Mentor, Resources, Secret Identity, Status.  Look these up in the
appropriate Storyteller system core rulebook.  Attunement and Dormancy may
also be taken; these appear in Aberrant.  Contacts, Dream, Equipment, and
Requisition appear here because they have special requirements for mutants
or different game mechanics.

Option: Backgrounds Beyond!

Superheroes (and villains) are larger than life.  Sometimes, because of
that, they've got backgrounds that we mortals can hardly imagine.  The
wealth of a Lex Luthor or a Tony Stark; the contacts of an Elijah Snow or a
Wolverine; the political power of a Darkseid or a Black Panther.  If the
Storyteller chooses to allow it, your characters may have Background scores
higher than five.  However, it requires the ST's expressed permission, and
each point above a score of five costs three Freebie points.  They're
expensive, so tread carefully.


Adamantium- Merit requirement.
	A mutant with the Weapon X Training Merit may choose to take this
	background, but nobody else.  This attribute represents a piece of
	equipment that is made of adamantium, a super-hard, virtually
	unbreakable metal.  Wolverine's claws and Cyber's skin were coated with
	this metal, but an adamantium sword is more common than Body Armour or
	Body Weaponry.

	A weapon made of adamantium has only a difficulty of 4 for the purposes
	of damage tests (rather than the normal 6).  It can cut through
	virtually anything, and is for nearly all intents and purposes
	indestructible.  Of course, it can be stolen...

	Armour composed of adamantium cannot be pierced, even by adamantium in
	most cases.  Full conversion Body Armour (skin-grafts or bonds like
	Cyber's) requires five points in this Background, and decreases the
	difficulty to soak blunt trauma to 5, or piercing damage to 4.  As Body
	Weaponry or Body Armour, Adamantium requires the Healing Factor Power
	at a minimum Rank equal to the rank of the background. Otherwise, if
	the mutant takes simple skin grafts but does not get five points in
	this Background, there are still a number of benefits. Punches or kicks
	from adamantium-sheathed fists and feet are diff 4, and body parts
	covered cannot be successfully targeted for extra damage from called
	shots, crits, etc.  Moreover, unarmed parries of weapons are possible.

	An adamantium-bonded skeleton, like Wolverine's, is unbreakable.  It
	will stop many blows (crushing attacks to the ribs can't really harm
	the character) and also give an automatic damage success in brawling.

	If the mutant has a healing factor and he took Body Armour or Body
	Weaponry with this Background) its effective level is reduced by the
	(level of the background -1) to a maximum loss of 3 levels.  Thus, the
	Adamantium Skeleton would reduce the effective level of a Healing
	Factor by 2.  Therefore, a normal human healing ability is insufficient
	to handle adamantium beyond level one.  If the Healing Factor is
	reduced to below zero, the mutant does not survive the bonding process.
	Internal implants (like skeletal bonding) increase the prerequisite
	level of the Healing Factor (though not the loss of effectiveness) by
	one.

	¥ A small item like a dagger or perhaps 5 clips of ammunition for a
	pistol.  In association with Body Weaponry, bonded finger-claws or
	teeth. As Body Armour, a hand, the space over the heart, or half of the
	head might be covered over with adamantium.  Weapons up to Strength + 2
	damage.
	¥¥ A larger item like a Strength + 3 weapon, the lower arm (from elbow
	to fingertips) on one side, etc.
	¥¥¥ A Strength + 4 weapon.  An adamantium-bonded skeleton is possible
	(requires the Healing Factor power at level 3 or higher).  Both lower
	arms,  one arm and shoulder, or one leg.
	¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 5 weapon, like Wolverine's claws.  The entire upper
	torso (excluding the head) or lower torso can be covered.
	¥¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 6 weapon.  The entire body save the head, or the
	groin, etc- like Cyber.  You'd better bring the electricity to deal
	with this one.  The "Sheeyah!  Maybe next chronicle!" level.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Full conversion.  A small vehicle, like a motorcycle or a
	subcompact car.

Allies
	Any mutant can have allies, and most need them.  Allies can be of
	any sort- normal humans, mutants, or even supernatural beings of
	some kind.  These are characters, not cannon fodder; if the mutant
	abuses an ally's friendship, he can expect to lose that ally.
	Each dot in this Background gives the mutant one ally or increases
	the power of an existing ally.  Note that a supremely powerful ally
	such as Charles Xavier, Apocalypse, or Nick Fury is worth five full
	points.  No, you can't have Galactus.

	¥ One ally of moderate power
	¥¥ Two allies, or one more powerful one
	¥¥¥ Three allies or less
	¥¥¥¥ Four allies or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five allies or less

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Seven allies or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Ten allies or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Fourteen allies or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nineteen allies or less
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Twenty-five allies or less
	
Attunement
	This ability is similar in some ways to Energy Channeling.  In essence,
	the mutant can invest the energy patterns of his mutant signature into
	objects, which allows these objects to behave like unstable molecule
	costumes- i.e., the objects are affected by the mutant's Power as if
	they were a part of the mutant's own body.  Therefore, a mutant with
	Energy Body (Fire) will not burn his clothing to ash if he has the
	Attunement Background; instead, they will transform into fire with him.
	Charged objects may be organic or inorganic, and must remain in
	continuous contact with the mutant in order to retain the benefits of
	the Attunement.

	¥ Objects may have a mass of up to 2 kg
	¥¥ Objects may have a mass of 5 kg
	¥¥¥ 10 kg
	¥¥¥¥ 25 kg
	¥¥¥¥¥ 100 kg

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ 250 kg
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ 400 kg
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ 650 kg
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ 800 kg
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ 900 kg

Carbonadium
	A very dangerous, very rare metal that was original touted as a less-
	expensive replacement for adamantium, carbonadium has a number of
	problems.  A mutant with Equipment ¥¥¥ (Carbonadium Synthesizer),
	Allies (Wolverine, Maverick, or John Wraith), or Status (Russian
	Government) may take this Background, but he may grow to wish that he
	hadn't. 
	
	Carbonadium is very hard, quite flexible and ductile when bathed in
	the proper radiation, but it is unstable.  It slowly decays, becoming
	depleted carbonadium (which is intensely poisonous) and releasing hard
	radiation as it does so.  Maintaining the carbonadium requires control
	of a carbonadium synthesizer.  In mainstream continuity, it appears
	that only one was ever made.
	
	Carbonadium does have some advantages.  It's nearly as hard as
	adamantium (offering diff. 5 damage tests when used as a weapon).  It
	is excellent at channeling certain powers (specifically, any Vampirism
	Power, any Power involving transfer of life force or death force, and
	hard radiation) offering a reduced (-1) difficulty on associated rolls
	using these Powers.
	
	A high-level Healing Factor, resistance to radiation, or some form of
	life-force vampirism is required if you want to live very long with
	carbonadium.  If the mutant does not have resistance to radiation, he
	will take one Health Level of damage per Rank per day (aggravated,
	difficulty 9 to soak) from radioactive decay.
	
	Bonding carbonadium as body armour or weaponry has similar requirements
	to adamantium, regarding Healing Factors and the like.
	
	¥ A small item like a dagger or perhaps 5 clips of ammunition for a
	pistol.  In association with Body Weaponry, bonded finger-claws or
	teeth. As Body Armour, a hand, the space over the heart, or half of the
	head might be covered over with adamantium.  Cyber's pacemaker fits
	into this category.  Weapons up to Strength + 2 damage.
	¥¥ A larger item like a Strength + 3 weapon, the lower arm (from elbow
	to fingertips) on one side, etc.
	¥¥¥ A Strength + 4 weapon.  A carbonadium-bonded skeleton is possible
	(requires the Healing Factor power at level 3 or higher).  Both lower
	arms,  one arm and shoulder, or one leg.
	¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 5 weapon, like Omega Red's tentacles.  The entire
	upper torso (excluding the head) or lower torso can be covered.
	¥¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 6 weapon.  The entire body save the head, or the
	groin, etc.  You'd better bring the electricity to deal with this one. 
	The "Sheeyah!  Maybe next chronicle!" level.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Full conversion.  A small vehicle, like a motorcycle or a
	subcompact car.
	
Clearance
	Often (though not invariably) going hand-in-hand with Status, Clearance
	makes an investigator's life much easier, giving him access to such
	things as government computer databases, tax records, and the like.
	The character must have some good reason for having this sort of thing
	(she might work for the FBI, or Revenue Canada, or the NYPD), but it
	sure expedites an investigation.  Each point in Clearance gives you
	one extra die for pertinent Computer and Investigations rolls, and it
	also cancels out the increased difficulty for one rank of Secret
	Identity.  Ranks above five are worth two extra dice apiece.

Contacts
	The mutant knows people in a variety of places.  Anywhere that you
	could conceive of having a person that would be useful to know, you can
	get an contact.  Each point in Contacts gets you one major contact (a
	TV reporter, an executive in the Kingpin's hierarchy, etc.) and a few
	minor contacts.  Contacts are people who are willing to do things for
	you, but they nearly always exact a price.  Mutants like Gambit and
	Sabretooth are well-connected; they have contacts all over the place
	(Contacts 5).

	Read Werewolf: the Apocalypse p. 111 for standard Contacts rules.

	Special Variation: Contacts packages- some associations come in large
	groups.  Perhaps due to a past association, your character is familiar
	with (and familiar to) the key players and several bit players in a
	particular social circle.  All difficulties for Powers Lore, Mutant
	Lore, and Area Knowledge relating to the package are reduced by one. 
	Secondary familiarity confers at least name recognition, if nothing
	else.

	Avengers package: familiarity with the Avengers, Avengers Mansion, the
	American government (at least on a P.R. level), and the membership of
	the Avengers- though perhaps not the current membership or a specific
	past member, depending on the nature of your association.  Secondary
	familiarity with the principal villains (Kang, the Masters of Evil,
	etc.) and all other major heroes (Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, etc.)
	Worth: 4

	Intelligence package: familiarity with the particular organization
	(I.O., Department H, S.H.I.E.L.D., Interpol, Black Air, etc.) that you
	belong(ed) to, including the directors, major field agents, protocols,
	famous operations, equipment, and hideouts. Secondary familiarity with
	all other intelligence agencies and their major agents.  Worth: 3

	Thunderbolts package: familiarity with the Thunderbolts and its
	membership.  Secondary familiarity with the Masters of Evil, the Vault,
	and small-time villains of all sorts, particularly criminal connections
	such as fences, arms dealers, arrangers, etc. Worth: 4.

	Weapon X package: familiarity with the Canadian government and its
	major installations.  Familiarity with Wolverine, Sabretooth, Silver
	Fox, Maverick, Mastodon, Wraith, Deadpool, Kane, Slayback, Ajax, and
	other Weapon X program graduates.  Secondary familiarity with (heard
	of) Alpha Flight and the covert operations community. Worth: 3

	Xavier package: familiarity with Westchester county, the Mansion, and
	the membership of the X-Men, X-Factor, X-Force, Generation X, and
	Excalibur- though perhaps not the current membership or a specific past
	member, depending on your particular association. Secondary familiarity
	with the principal villains: Magneto, Apocalypse, Mr. Sinister, Stryfe,
	etc.  Worth: 4

Destiny
	It's true, this is a trait that not just any old mutant can have,
	but with time-travel these days, some people know that they are going
	to do something great.  Think of Cable, who is destined to battle
	Apocalypse to the death, or Adam X, who will rule the Shi'ar Empire.
	Mutants with destinies rarely die in skirmishes against the Trapster.
	They have some higher purpose, and knowledge of this lends them
	strength.  Once per story, the mutant can make a Destiny roll (diff.
	eight) and regain Willpower (one per success) to avoid a cheap
	death.  This Destiny does not have to be well-defined, but rather
	should remain shadowy for as long as possible.
	
	Special Flaw: Dark Destiny (1-3 pt. Flaw)- the mutant knows something
	about his Destiny, at least.  Unfortunately, it's not a particularly
	nice one.  Anakin Skywalker, for instance, had a dark destiny.  In
	this case, the mutant may still use the background as per normal, but
	may suffer from nightmares (roll Destiny when the mutant sleeps; if
	he fails or botches, he loses Willpower equal to the amount of this
	Flaw).

Dormancy
	This is a rare background, but it is available to all mutants.  In
	essence, any mutant who does not have an uncontrollable Power can elect
	to take this Background, which allows him to supress his mutant
	'signature', which is what mutant detection devices use to distinguish
	different mutants (and indeed, a mutant from a human).  Unfortunately,
	a mutant that is dormant cannot immediately use his active Powers.  It
	takes one round for the mutant to 'turn on' after he suppresses his
	signature.  When the mutant is dormant, he cannot regenerate Power
	Charge.  While dormant, the mutant rolls Stealth + Dormancy to resist
	mutant detection by mechanical devices or other mutants.

Dream- Power requirement.
	If the mutant has one of the Powers: Dream Manipulation, Dream Travel,
	Telepathy, Hedge Magick, Precognition, or Gnosis, he can take this
	Background, which taps into the universal unconscious.  Otherwise, it
	is exactly as it appears in Mage: the Ascension. 

Equipment*
	The Equipment trait works much like the Talisman background from the
	Mage: the Ascension game.  The mutant possesses a device that contains
	one Rank of power per dot- it may have multiple, low-Rank Powers, or
	it may have a single, high-Rank Power.  Because this is a very powerful
	advantage, this Background costs double (two points for one dot).  One
	example of a powerful piece of Equipment is Cable's favourite plasma
	gun, which has the Power: Energy Emission (Plasma) ¥¥¥, and thus costs
	six points to purchase (all of his Background points, plus a Freebie
	point).  The Storyteller is free to limit these pieces of Equipment
	however he likes (for instance, Body Armour may limit mobility, thus
	cutting your Dexterity dice pools, and a gun like Cable's must be
	recharged after a certain number of shots).
	
	Some discretion should definitely be exercised by the Storyteller; some
	Powers (such as Telepathy, Hyper-Invention, or Hedge Magick) should not
	be allowed as Equipment.  Some pieces of Equipment should have size
	restrictions (a machine that duplicates the Gateway or Duplication
	power should not be man-portable, perhaps weighing several tons) and
	the Storyteller is free to veto any piece of Equipment, place any
	restriction on it, or disallow this Background altogether. 
	
	Equipment can not develop Power Stunts; however, a particular Power
	Stunt can be treated as its own Power.

	¥ One Rank of Power
	¥¥ Two Ranks
	¥¥¥ Three Ranks
	¥¥¥¥ Four Ranks
	¥¥¥¥¥ Five Ranks
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Six Ranks of Power, but no individual Power can be higher than
	five.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Seven Ranks, not above 5.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Eight Ranks, not above 5.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Nine Ranks, not above 5.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Ten Ranks of Power, but no individual Power can be higher
	than Rank six.

Home Turf (Haven)
	Some mutants are not interested in donning spandex and running around
	New York City fighting crime.  Some come to such a career later in
	life.  In any case, certain mutants frequently go out of their way to
	secure 'home field advantage' for themselves in case any hostiles ever
	come knocking.  This frequently involves an area that is particularly
	conducive to escape and/or the use of the mutant's powers.  For
	instance, a mutant with Plant Control might live in the Everglades.

	¥ Your haven is the size of your apartment or house (In fact, that's
	probably what it is).  All Evasion, Search and Stealth rolls are at -1
	difficulty (due to your extensive knowledge of the surrounds) and Area
	Knowledge rolls pertaining to your Turf have an automatic success. 
	You are treated as having one Rank of Status on your Turf by
	inhabitants and frequent visitors, even without that background
	(although if you don't have the background, then you'll be treated
	differently by the same people if you meet them off your Turf).
	¥¥ Evasion, Search and Stealth rolls are at -2 difficulty, and Area
	Knowledge rolls have two automatic successes.  You have Status ¥¥
	while on your Turf, which is the size of three or four city blocks. 
	All Social difficulties are reduced by one.
	¥¥¥ Perception + Alertness rolls are at -1 difficulty on your Turf
	(you have a keen eye for what belongs).  Area Knowledge rolls have
	three automatic successes.  You have Status ¥¥¥ while on your Turf,
	which is the size of a neighbourhood.  You may also have one good
	'ambush site' set up, which will either increase your opponent's
	difficulty for all physical maneuvers by one, or allow you to attack
	from concealment.
	¥¥¥¥ Your haven is the size of a small town.  All Evasion, Search,
	and Stealth rolls are reduced in difficulty by three.  All Social
	difficulties are reduced by two, and you have Status ¥¥¥¥ while on
	your Turf.  You have up to three good ambush sites set up.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Your haven is the size of a large town.  You have five Ranks in
	Status while on your Turf.  You have up to five ambush sites set up.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Your turf is the size of a small city (10,000 + citizens). You
	have five Ranks in Status on your turf, and up to seven ambush sites
	set up.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Your turf is the size of a medium city, or the borough of a
	large city such as London or New York.  Evasion, Search, and Stealth
	rolls are at -3 difficulty, and Area Knowledge rolls have four auto
	successes.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ A large city (1,000,000 citizens or so) makes up your turf.
	You have five Ranks in Status everywhere, and up to ten ambush sites.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ A metropolis (New York, Mexico City, London) makes up your
	turf.  You have five Ranks in Status while on it.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ A small country (such as Wakanda, Symkaria, or Latveria)
	comprises your turf.  You have six effective Ranks of Status there,
	and at least five ambush sites in every settlement, as well as ten
	discretionary ambush sites.

Mentor
	This background works just like the normal one, save that your mentor
	will be some sort of mutant or organization concerned with them.  The
	more useful and knowledgeable your mentor would be, the more points you
	must invest in this Background.  Gambit, for instance, makes a great
	Ally, but is an irresponsible and little-trusted mutant, which makes
	him a relatively poor Mentor.  And, while the Scarlet Witch could
	hardly be called the most knowledgeable mutant, her great influence
	makes up for that deficit, giving her a rating of ¥¥¥. Great adventure
	hook and/or 'puller of butt out of the fire'.

	¥ A less-powerful and influential mutant, but one who knows the skinny.
	Quicksilver, Iceman, Jubilee, Sunfire, Rogue, Siryn, Deadpool.
	¥¥ Your mentor knows some people, and knows some things, as well. 
	Domino, Archangel, Polaris, Madrox, Gambit, Shadowcat, Val Cooper,
	Toad, Maverick.
	¥¥¥ Your mentor is in the know, and wields a fair bit of influence. 
	The Dark Beast, Havok, Wolverine, Sabretooth, Nightcrawler, Scarlet
	Witch.
	¥¥¥¥ An extremely influential and knowledgeable mutant.  Examples
	include Cyclops, Cable, Department H, Banshee, the White Queen, Storm,
	Forge.
	¥¥¥¥¥ A vastly powerful and/or influential mutant.  Your mentor knows
	it all and his plans shape the Earth.  Charles Xavier, Apocalypse,
	Sinister, Sebastian Shaw, Magneto, LL&L, Stryfe.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Someone truly hideous, such as a minor cosmic entity (Galactus,
	the Watcher) or the ruler of an interstellar empire (Lilandra, the
	Supreme Intelligence) is your mentor.

Requisition- Background requirement.
	If your mutant has the Status background at 3 or higher with an
	appropriate organization, she may also get the Requisition background,
	which works like a lending library, except with Equipment.  Basically,
	the mutant can't have a higher score in Requisition than she has in
	Status, but the expense in Freebies can be worth it.  In any case, the
	organization must be well-funded and well-equipped.  Examples of
	appropriate organizations are International Operations, SHIELD, Landau
	Luckman and Lake, Department H, AIM, Hydra, and Black Air.  There are
	certainly other such organizations.  Ask your ST which ones might be
	appropriate for your chronicle.  The Storyteller also has the right to
	cap the Rank of Powers offered, and has control over what is available
	and what is not.

	¥ The mutant may borrow one or more pieces of Rank 1 Equipment (as per
	the background) on approval by her superiors.  She may get one piece at
	a time per point in Status with the organization.  Note that approval
	is not automatic; it's not likely your mutant is going to get a
	nullfire gun.  Note that this equipment is expected to be returned in a
	timely fashion and in good condition.  Failure to do so may result in
	loss of Status, loss of Requisition, or a fat drain on your Resources.
	¥¥ One or more pieces of Rank 2 Equipment may be withdrawn.  A pair of
	Rank 1 Equipment may be substituted for piece of Rank 2 Equipment.
	¥¥¥ One or more pieces of Rank 3 Equipment may be withdrawn, or the
	equivalent (instead of three pieces of Rank 3 equipment, four pieces of
	Rank 2 and one Rank 1).
	¥¥¥¥ One or more pieces of Rank 4 equipment, or the appropriate number
	of lesser pieces.  Note that getting approval for a piece of equipment
	that is the equivalent of a Rank 4 Power is very difficult, and should
	take several days (if not weeks).  This is Invisibility or Psychic
	Invulnerability we're talking about here, after all.  The penalties for
	losing or damaging such a piece are dire.  A Rank 4 piece that just has
	a pair of Rank 2 Powers or four Rank 1 Powers would not be particularly
	difficult, by comparison.
	¥¥¥¥¥ One or more pieces of Rank 5 equipment, which is no doubt the
	acme of development for these organizations.  Even a character with
	Status 5 had better tread lightly...

Resources
	If your mutant does not live hand-to-mouth, he probably has Resources
	of some kind.  The Morlocks have no Resources, but most other mutants
	have some rating in this trait, which is what they live on.  Mutants
	like Wolverine, Charles Xavier, and Emma Frost have enough money to
	live without having to hold a regular job, which is a big advantage
	when you have to go out weekly to fight Graviton.  More points =
	more comfortable = less liquid.

	¥ College student subsistence level.  A ratty apartment, maybe an old
	car, and enough food in the cupboards to live through the week.  If
	liquidated, you'd be worth about $1000.  Monthly allowance of about
	$500.
	¥¥ You've made it into lower middle class.  Wolverine has enough money
	to sustain this lifestyle indefinitely.  A condo or a nice apartment,
	a relatively new car, etc.  If you had to sell it all, you'd get about
	$8,000.  Monthly allowance of about $1200.
	¥¥¥ You aren't working at Safeway, that's for sure.  A comfortable
	existence, with a paid-off house or condo and maybe a ratty summer
	shack in the country that you haven't got around to fixing.  You're
	probably driving this year's car.  If you sold everything, you'd be
	worth about $50,000.  Monthly allowance of $3000.
	¥¥¥¥ Isn't this nice?  You're visibly wealthy, though you'd still
	look like a peasant next to Bill Gates.  You've got a large house,
	all paid, multiple vehicles (maybe even a boat!) and a few nice
	stock options here and there.  Don't hold your breath on that
	private jet, though.  If liquidated, Auction Mart would have to pay
	you about $500,000.  Monthy allowance of about 9 G's.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Woo hoo!  You've made it to the big time, my brother.  Like
	the White Queen, Sebastian Shaw, and other Hellfire alumni, you
	probably own one or more major corporations (Frost International,
	for instance) and you're livin' large.  No telling how much you'd
	get if you sold it all, but it's probably in the $500 mill range.
	Monthly allowance of 30 large.  Merry Christmas.

	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Hideous wealth.  You're at the helm of one of the world's
	leading multinationals (Stark-Fujikawa, Mitsubishi, etc.) or are the
	dictator of a smallish country.  Liquidation value is nearly
	incalculable, but it's in the billions somewhere.  Monthly allowance of
	one million dollars.  Requires a minimum Status of six.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Obscene wealth.  Luthor and Tony Stark hate your guts.  You
	are at the absolute command of a wealthy country (Canada-sized). It
	would probably be impossible to liquidate without being liquidated.
	Monthly allowance of five million.  Requires a minimum Status of eight.
	
Secret Identity
	Your character has decided to lead a double life, not wanting the world
	to know that he is a mutant.  Perhaps he is famous, or merely paranoid.
	At any rate, while mutants such as Logan and Hank McCoy have eschewed
	the secret identity route, it may be the most clever thing for your
	character.  This Background also allows the truly paranoid to have
	several pre-made identities available in case it hits the fan.  Every
	point in this Background makes it more difficult to follow the ID's
	paper trail (+1 difficulty to Investigation or Computer rolls per Rank,
	as applicable, to find out that the identity is a sham).

	¥ One secret ID, with a shaky background story.  It may be a bit
	implausible, or at least relatively easy to see through if you were
	investigated.
	¥¥ One secret ID, with a solid cover story and good track-covering. It
	may well not be the ID you were born with.  If it is not, you at least
	have some convincing-looking documents.
	¥¥¥ One or two secret IDs, with bank records and fully legitimate
	documentation- though a serious error may still expose you.
	¥¥¥¥ Up to three secret identities, with full tax records.  It is
	entirely possible that your different identities are citizens of
	different countries.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Up to four secret IDs, with the whole works.  Unless you commit a
	major blunder, they'll never figure it out.  Buy the Disguise skill,
	why don't you?
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ You have a foolproof method of creating a new, watertight
	secret ID with only a week's notice.  Requires Resources 4 or Status 4
	with an appropriate agency.

Sidekick
	Similar in some respects to the Ally background, the Sidekick is
	another super-powered being, almost fanatically loyal to the mutant,
	who has joined the cause.  Like Robin, Jubilee, or Bucky Barnes, this
	person is a partner, but one of lesser ability or experience.  You (the
	player) should have some input into the sidekick's creation, backstory,
	etc., but the Storyteller should also be involved, and will have the
	final word on the particulars of your character's sidekick.  Note that
	this Background may be taken several times, representing several
	different sidekicks.
	
	¥ The sidekick starts with Attributes at 6/4/3, Abilities at 11/7/4,
	two Ranks of Powers, no Backgrounds, and five Freebie points.
	¥¥ The sidekick gains an additional Rank of Powers and two additional
	Freebies.
	¥¥¥ One additional Rank of Powers (for a total of 4) and three more
	Freebies (for a total of 10).
	¥¥¥¥ One additional Rank of Powers, two additional Freebies, and two
	points of Backgrounds.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Attributes increase to 7/5/3 and three additional Freebies for a
	total of: Attributes 7/5/3, Abilities 11/7/4, Backgrounds 2, Freebies
	fifteen points, five Ranks of Powers.

Status
	Not every mutant is well-respected by others of his kind.  Some mutants
	have a gift for leadership, or at least a really mean rep.  Wolverine
	is legendary among the Morlocks.  Xavier is the most respected mutant
	on the planet.  Mutants with status will have more responsibility, and
	others will defer to them.  Status must be bought separately for each
	major social group that your character belongs to: for instance, the
	Morlocks, the Acolytes, the X.S.E., the whole Xavier brood, etc.  High
	status can lower Social difficulties in some situations.

	¥ People recognize you when you raise your hand.
	¥¥ Your group listens when you speak.
	¥¥¥ Your opinion is respected when given.
	¥¥¥¥ They seek out your opinion when any issue comes up.
	¥¥¥¥¥ What you say is pretty much the way it's going to be.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Large and in charge.  Someone like Tony Stark with regard to
	Stark-Fujikawa.  You make all important decisions and have the
	authority to change the group's direction or remove people from the
	group.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ Larger and in charge-r.  As Rank 6, but with regard to a very
	large entity, such as a small or medium country.  You may not have
	absolute authority, but it will approach that of the American
	President.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥ Absolute dictator.  The ruler of a large and powerful
	country.  Imagine Stalin or Hitler, but with Castro's popularity. Your
	powers are unlimited.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥ Ruler of a planet (not Earth)
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥¥¥¥ Like Lilandra or the Supreme Intelligence, you direct the
	activities of a galactic empire.

Training Facilities- Background requirement.
	Some mutants (and mutant teams) have special facilities which allow
	them to keep in top shape when they are inactive, or even learn more
	about how to use their powers.  The X-Men have the fabled Danger Room,
	which uses forcefields, robots, holograms, and energy beams to
	simulate a variety of situations- all powered by an alien computer. 
	Most mutants can't get Shi'ar technology, but they can still benefit
	from a lesser facility.
	
	These facilities aren't cheap, however, and there is a prerequisite for
	this Background of a minimum level of the Resources Background.
	Fortunately, several mutants can pool their Resources (and Background
	points) to qualify for and purchase this Background.  For example, five
	mutants, each with Resources 2, qualify for Training Facilities 5. Each
	of them would spend one Background point to get the facility. 
	
	Whenever the mutant wants to purchase a Talent or Skill, or increase a
	Rank in a Power, he can spend a number of weeks training in the
	facility equal to the current rating of the ability or Power, which
	will take the pressure off.  When it comes time to spend the
	Experience, the mutant may roll his rating in Training Facilities
	(diff 7).  The number of successes he gets in this roll equals the
	number of Experience points he saves- these are preserved.  A minimum
	of one point of Experience must always be spent, and the mutant may
	only roll once every time he spends Experience.
	
	¥ A high quality gym to keep your mutant in top shape.  Two dots in
	Resources.
	¥¥ A gym with some special extra equipment (like a wind tunnel, or a
	centrifuge training machine).  Four dots in Resources.
	¥¥¥ A gym and arena with moveable walls and some surprising mechanical
	devices and robots- much like a nasty obstacle course that can be
	reconfigured.  Six dots in Resources.
	¥¥¥¥ A gym and arena which can simulate situations using sophisticated
	robotics with holograms superimposed over them.  Eight dots in
	Resources.
	¥¥¥¥¥ Full Danger Room facilities.  It can simulate almost any
	situation, and has a variety of danger settings.  Ten dots in
	Resources.
	
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ The equivalent of a Star Trek holodeck with personal trainers. 
	Reduce the difficulty to use this Background to 6.    Requires a
	hideous fourteen dots in Resources.
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥¥ As the sixth Rank, but the personal trainers approach the
	effectiveness of Wolverine, Captain America, or even the Taskmaster.
	These trainers have a specialty-- select one Talent or Skill.  It can
	be increased to six with Experience.  Requires eighteen dots of
	Resources.

Vibranium- Background requirement.
    A mutant with Allies (Black Panther) or Status (Wakandan Government)
    may take this Background.  It represents a piece of equipment that is
    highly damage-resistant and particularly effective against sonic and
    vibratory attacks.  Vibraxas and the Black Panther both have this
    advantage.

    A weapon made of vibranium is very hard, but not so hard that it has
    the kind of damage bonuses that adamantium offers.  However, it can
    be used to lower the damage difficulty for the Vibration Channeling
    Power by one, and is also capable of disrupting sound or vibration-
    based forcefields.

    Armour made of vibranium is tough.  It absorbs double its Rank in
    bashing damage, and soaks any blunt trauma at diff 4.  It can also
    protect against sonic and vibration attacks, granting two automatic
    soak against these per Rank and also reducing the soak difficulty
    to four.

    It is possible to take this Background in conjunction with Body
    Weaponry, but there is no known process that allows Body Armour, except
    as equipment.  It is insufficiently flexible.  A vibranium- bonded
    skeleton would offer two automatic soak vs. blunt, sonic, and vibration
    attacks.  It would also eliminate a lot of organ damage and brain
    damage from falls, protecting the spine and brain from any serious
    injury.  Falls would only inflict bashing damage (which would not wrap
    around to become lethal damage)-- unless, of course, the mutant fell
    onto something really sharp...

	Any sonic Power that is channeled through something like Klaw's
	vibranium cone can increase its damage pool by one die per point.
	
	Variation: Antarctic Vibranium- a slightly different configuration for
	the metal, and a less stable one than Wakandan vibranium.  Klaw, the
	master of sound, has this sort of vibranium, and the Black Panther's
	claws are composed of it.  The antarctic variety has the following
	properties:
	
	* Sound Absorption/Conversion- one Rank per level.  Automatically has
	the Store stunt.
	* Vibration Absorption/Conversion- one Rank per level.  Automatically
	has the Store stunt.
	* Anti-metal- Antarctic vibranium causes metals that it comes into
	contact with to break down.  The damage test for this substance vs.
	metal is equivalent to Adamantium (diff. 4 damage tests).
	* Instability- if too much sound or vibration is absorbed into the
	item without being released somehow (it does not do this naturally),
	the vibranium explodes.  This converts the stored energy to the 
	equivalent Rank of Explosive Force Generation and destroys the item.
	* Channels sonic Powers as Wakandan vibranium, which can obviate the
	instability problem.

    ¥ A small item like a dagger or perhaps 5 clips of ammunition for a
    pistol.  In association with Body Weaponry, bonded finger-claws or          
    teeth.  Would also cover footwear; adds one automatic Stealth
    success, since it absorbs the sound.
    ¥¥ A larger item like a Strength + 2 weapon.
    ¥¥¥ A Strength + 3 weapon.  A vibranium-bonded skeleton is possible
    (requires the Healing Factor power at level 3 or higher).
    ¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 4 weapon, like Wolverine's claws.
    ¥¥¥¥¥ A Strength + 5 weapon.
    
	¥¥¥¥¥ ¥ Full conversion.  A small vehicle, like a motorcycle or a
	subcompact car.


							EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT

Experience Point Awards

Most Storytellers of the Mutant system will have played another White Wolf
game before, and will therefore know how the experience points are given
out. Some people may not have a sourcebook containing the different
categories available, though, so here are the eight standard experience
point categories for this game, with two additional (optional) points:


These points are to be given out at the end of every game session.

Automatic: all characters that participated receive one Experience point
automatically.

Learning Curve: to be eligible for this point, the player must be able to
identify something significant that her character learned during the game
session. Storytellers may wish to require that this piece of information be
especially relevant to the character, or that each player come up with a
different piece of data.

Roleplaying: to reward exceptional roleplaying only. When a player gives an
excellent performance, award one of these points. Raise your standards as
the campaign goes on. This should be one of the most difficult points to
earn.

Concept or Internal Consistency Point: this is another roleplaying point in
disguise, but it is much easier to qualify for. If the character behaved in
a fashion that clove closely to her concept, or if she stuck her Nature and
Demeanor especially well, then this point should be awarded.

Heroism: Traditionally one of the more difficult points to get. The
character must have risked his life or suffered a serious setback in order
to save another character in order to qualify for this point.

[OPTIONAL] Style: It is awarded when a character succeeds at a certain task
and, moreover, manages to look good doing it.  Not to be awarded if the
action was out of character for the person or persons involved.


At the end of a story, the characters may also qualify for one or more of
these three experience points.

Success: This point does not require a complete and total success. If the
goals of the party or of an individual character were at least partially
achieved, then the character is eligible for a success point.

Danger: If the character was seriously threatened during the course of the
story, then he deserves a danger point- whether he came through it with all
of his limbs intact or not.

Wits and Resourcefulness: Award this point when the player came up with an
especially innovative plan that was instrumental in allowing the party to
succeed or survive.

[OPTIONAL] Teamwork: Whenever two or more characters 'team up' in some way
to achieve a goal, showing exceptional melding abilities, a teamwork point
can be awarded.  It should be awarded for a new effort (not something that
has been done several times) that used the unique capabilities of each
participant.

Note that optional experience points can either be used to replace one of
the existing categories (Style to replace Learning or Concept point,
Teamwork to replace Danger point) or, at the ST's option, to be included in
addition to regular categories.  Note that this can "speed up" character
advancement significantly.


Experience Point Costs:
	Attributes: 4 x current
	Abilities: 3 (new) or 2 x current
	Actual Power Level: 4 x current
	Power Potential: Cannot be improved
	Power Charge: 4 x current
	New Power: 10/10/15 for the first Rank.
	Primary Powers: 6 x current
	Secondary Powers: 8 x current
	Tertiary Powers: Cannot be improved
	Primary Stunts: 3
	Secondary Stunts: 5
	Tertiary Stunts: 7
	Willpower: 2 x current

Thus, for a Rank one Power, the mutant pays 10 Experience.  For a Rank two
Power in the mutant's Primary category, he pays 16 Experience. For a Rank
three Power in the mutant's Secondary category, he pays (10 + 8 + 16) or 34
Experience.  ONLY ONE RANK can be purchased at a time unless the power is
of fixed Rank (like Invisibility).

For example, Siege goes on an adventure with Iceman, and the two of them
manage to defeat Graviton.  The miserly ST awards him only six experience points
for his heroic effort.

Keith thought about saving the points, but decided that Seth would probably
improve a lot at the start of his career.  He examined his options for spending
the points.

He had enough experience to increase his Manipulation by one, but that would use
most of his points, and besides which, the ST ruled that he hadn't used his
Manipulation enough during the adventure to justify the increase.  Raising his
Intelligence would cost eight points, which he didn't have, so Keith passed over
Attributes.

Keith looked longingly at his Powers, but to increase his Force Absorption, a
Physical Power, to Rank four would cost 6 x current, or 18 points.  The Energy
Absorption Power, in his secondary category, would cost 8 x current, or 24 points.
Quite out of his league.  Besides, as the ST reminded him, Seth's Actual Power
Level would have to increase to four before he could increase those Powers anyway,
and that would cost 4 x current, or twelve points.

Keith briefly considered improving his Willpower, but he couldn't really
justify it.  It would have cost 12 points anyway.

On the other hand, Keith could improve Siege's Power Charge (2 x current = 6
points) but that would take all of his points, and for a less than palpable
result.

Seth had started developing a Power Stunt, but he hadn't used it five times
yet, and so couldn't spend the three points to buy it.

Keith therefore decides to spend the experience on buying a new Ability, 
Survival, for three points.  He spends two of the remaining points to improve
his Stealth to Rank two, and saves the remaining point for later.


							ADVANTAGES AND HEALTH
							
A mutant, like a normal character in the World of Darkness, has seven
health levels.  When he takes too many injuries, they begin to interfere
with the character's effectiveness (and he takes penalties to most dice
pools).  The health levels are as measured as damage is taken, as follows:

Bruised: no penalty 
Hurt: Subtract one point from dice pools. 
Injured: Subtract one point from dice pools (not cumulative). 
Wounded: Subtract two points from dice pools. 
Mauled: Subtract two points from dice pools.
Crippled: Subtract five points from dice pools. 
Incapacitated: Unconcsiousness.  Incapable of taking action.

Not counted on the character sheet are levels indicating full health
(imagine it as being above "bruised") and death (below "incapacitated").

There are different kinds of damage as well, depending on how it is
administered. A typical punch, for example, inflicts bashing damage.
Bashing damage heals quickly, and it can't easily kill you.  A knife or
bullet, by contrast, inflicts lethal damage.  That heals more slowly, and
it can kill you.  A flamethrower, acid, or something equally awful inflicts
the dreaded aggravated damage.  Aggravated damage can kill you, and it
heals very slowly.  Rarely, permanent damage can be taken. Just cross off
that health level; it's gone.

Damage taken starts at the top of the health level chart on the character
sheet and moves down, toward incapacitation and death.

Bashing damage heals at the rate of one Health Level per day. Note that
bashing damage can't kill a mutant; once you exceed Incapacitated, start at
the top again and mark all further bashing damage as lethal. As always,
lethal damage overlays bashing damage and aggravated damage overlays
either.

A normal human recovers lethal damage at the following rate:
Bruised: One day
Hurt (first -1): Three days
Injured (second -1 and all -1s that follow it): One week
Wounded (first -2): Two weeks
All Health Levels beyond Wounded: One month

Note that the figures given above are not the time required to heal fully,
but to heal a single health level.  Someone who has been Mauled, for
instance, would take one month to heal to Wounded, two weeks to heal to
Injured, one week to heal to Hurt, three days to heal to Bruised, and then
one day to be tip-top, for a total of one month, three weeks, and four
days.  Ouch.

Aggravated damage heals at a slower rate than lethal damage, as follows:
Bruised: Three days
Hurt (first -1): One week
Injured (second -1 and all -1s that follow it): Two weeks
All Health Levels beyond Injured: One month

Hospital stays (surgery and expert medical attention, etc.) will help speed
this process along.  Each Health Level of damage (unless it's bashing) will
heal as if it were one category less in severity if the mutant stays in the
hospital for a few days, and sees a doctor or physiotherapist regularly
until healed.

Extra health levels can be gained in a few ways by a mutant.  The best way
is through the Power of that name.  The player, when purchasing an extra
health level, decides where it goes and thereby chooses a dice penalty for
it that corresponds to the existing health levels (either no penalty, -1,
-2, -5, or unconsciousness).  Most players choose the "no penalty" option,
meaning that the new health levels are placed adjacent to existing "no
penalty" health levels (above or below the Bruised level, or other new
levels without penalty).  However, some players have even been known to
take extra incapacitated levels from a sense of paranoia.

Health levels that are associated with body armour are always recorded at
the top of the sheet, as they are separate from the mutant's own health
levels.  They each may have any dice penalty number desired (if the player
is fond of realism), but these penalties only apply to physical dice pools,
and are negated when the armour loses its last health level.

Power Charge recovers at the rate of one point per day of complete rest. 
In conjunction with Accelerated Recovery, Charge Building, or similar
abilities, it recovers much more quickly (as per the Power description).

Rage is recovered in a number of ways.  Whenever the character is exposed
to a situation that is exceptionally frustrating, then the player can ask
for one or more points.  It is also recovered at the rate of one point per
week, otherwise. If the character has the Stunt: Rage Regeneration, of
course, he can use those rules.

Gnosis is recovered chiefly through meditation (Wits + Enigmas, diff 8, or
Wits + Meditation, diff 7) with each success restoring a point of Gnosis. 
Any failed roll increases the difficulty to meditate by one for that day. 
A successful meditation lasts one hour; a failed one lasts the same.  A
botched meditation may last a lot longer.

Willpower is regained in a number of ways.  At the end of a story (not a
game session), the characters regain all the Willpower they spent, unless
the ending was unsatisfactory.  A special success (such as getting a
spectacular maneuver roll in a critical situation) may also merit the
recharge of a point or two.  Also, when she fulfills some criterion of her
chosen Nature, she may restore a point or two of Willpower.  The Destiny
background and being a Social character also supply ways of restoring
Willpower.  Optionally, characters may meditate to recover Willpower using
the same mechanics as Gnosis, except successive rolls always increase in
difficulty (whether the last roll was successful or not).  Multiple rolls
at difficulty 10 are not allowed.


							APPENDICES AND OPTIONAL RULES

Appendix One: Martial Arts Rules (from Kindred of the East)

If you are interested in expanded rules for the Martial Arts skill (as it
differs from Brawl), these have been pretty much lifted from Kindred of the
East, a Vampire supplement.  The page numbers in question are 140-141. The
additional techniques below are from the Kindred of the East Companion, pp.
131-134.  I strongly recommend that you buy these products if you're
playing a Vampire campaign.  Good stuff.

Learning and improvement of Martial Arts (even from rank one to rank two)
can not be done successfully without a master.  The master can teach
martial arts up to one rank lower than her own rank (thus, a sifu with
Martial Arts 4 can bring her students up to rank 3, but no higher) unless
she has the Instruction skill, in which case the students may be able to
match her rank.

In essence, there are two basic categories under which martial arts
typically fall.  Arts like karate, most variations of kung-fu, and
kickboxing are considered hard styles.  Arts such as judo, aikido, and t'ai
chi are soft styles.  Hard styles concentrate more on direct attack.  Soft
styles are more concerned with redirection of force.  Here are the
basic maneuver difficulties for the two styles:

Soft
Strike: 6
Kick: 7
Grapple: 5
Throw: 6

Hard
Strike: 5
Kick: 6
Grapple: 6
Throw: 7

Strikes, kicks, and grapples, I trust, are obvious.

The Throw: Having successfully grappled an opponent, the martial artist may
attempt to throw him to the ground. This maneuver requires a Dexterity +
Martial Arts roll, with a damage pool equal to the attacker's Strength. A
successful throw can also stun an opponent if it inflicts three or more
Health Levels of damage. Stunned characters suffer a two-dice penalty to
all actions for a number of turns equal to the damage taken.

For each dot after the first, a character may have one maneuver.


Soft Styles

Counter Throw: The: martial artist uses the attacker's own momentum against
him. The defender ho longer needs to grapple an opponent before throwing
him and instead makes an opposed roll of Dexterity + Martial Arts against
the attacker's Dexterity + Brawl, Melee, or Martial Arts (whichever is
currently appropriate). If the martial artist scores more successes she
deflects the attack and may immediately attempt to throw the attacker.

Deflecting Block: The martial artist, concentrating entirely on defense,
tries to prevent her opponent from doing any damage, and throw him off
balance in the process. When blocking, the martial artist redirects the
attacker's momentum and rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts (difficulty 6)
against the opponent's attack roll. Each of the defender's successes
subtracts one success from the attacker's roll. If the martial artist
scores more success than the attacker, the attacker must roll Dexterity
(difficulty 8) or fall to the ground and take his own Strength rating as
damage.

Joint Lock: Having successfully grappled her opponent, a martial artist can
damage or control him by applying pressure to joints or pressure points.
This torsion often results in broken arms, legs and even necks. The martial
artist rolls Dexterity + Martial Arts to grapple, then may immediately roll
Dex + Martial arts again to inflict damage. For each success scored, the
martial artist inflicts one Health Level of damage.

Mantis Strike: This open-handed blow targets an opponent's vital organs or
(against undead opponents) Chi gates and vitae centers.  Difficulty 7,
damage Str  + loss of one Chi (if Kuei-jin) or blood point (if Kindred).
Against mortals, the Mantis Strike inflicts Str + 1 damage.

Withering Grasp: By making a successful Dexterity + Martial Arts roll, the
martial artist may not only inflict damage on her foe, but disarm him as
well. The martial artist must score at least three success to disarm the
foe; with five successes, she may take the weapon for her own use.


Hard Styles

Blow to Pressure Point: The martial artist learns to strike the pressure
points and Chi meridians in  the body, thus causing significant damage.
Difficulty 8, damage Str + 3.

Damaging Block: The martial artist's blocks are really attacks aimed at
attacking limbs.  Make a normal Block roll, but if the artist scores three
or more successes, she also inflicts her Strength in damage.

Dragon Tail Sweep: This spinning leg sweep can knock the martial artist's
opponent to the ground. Treat this maneuver like a Throw, but the martial
artist does not have to grapple with the opponent. Difficulty 8, damage
(opponent's Strength).

Elbow Strike: A quick,  vicious blow, usually delivered to the head at
close range. Difficulty 5, damage Str + 1.

Spinning Kick:  This fast, powerful kick does significant damage to
opponents, and looks impressive as well.  Difficulty 7, damage Str + 2.

Thunder Kick: This deadly flying drop kick is both graceful and
debilitating.  Difficulty 8, damage Str + 3.


Additional Hard Techniques-- requires a Martial Arts score of at least 4.

Breaking Blow: Fists and feet hardened with rigourous practice, toughened by
beating hot sand or water, and charged with concentration-- the powerful
strikes of a dedicated martial artist can break wood, brick and bone. 
Performing a breaking blow requires a full turn of concentration, as the
martial artist aims the blow and focuses his energies. The final strike (if
it hits) adds one additional level of damage for every two full successes
scored on the attack roil. (For example, the player of a character who
achieved two successes on an attack roll would roll Strength +2 dice of
damage instead of Strength +1.) The player should roll to strike even
against inanimate objects, simply to determine the level of additional
success.  This is still bashing damage unless the martial artist also knows
the Killing Blow technique.  Due to the force of the blow, though, the
martial artist suffers bashing damage equal to half of the attack's damage
(before soak rolls, rounded down).  Thus, if the martial artist inflicts
five levels of damage upon the opponent, he suffers two levels of bashing
damage himself, though this damage may be soaked normally by both parties
Botching a breaking blow generally results in the martial artist crippling
or breaking his own striking limb; the martial artist suffers a level of
lethal damage.

Ground Fighting: Exotic styles like Penjak Silat stress the need to fight
effectively in any terrain, under any conditions.  Instead of flailing
about aimlessly, a skilled fighter can use prone combat to her advantage. 
Skill in ground fighting allows a martial artist to attack and defend
normally while crouching or prone; she suffers no penalties.  Of course,
the character must still be able to reach her targets.

Jump Kick: Leaping into the air, usually with a great cry or even a running
leap, the martial artist plants a devastating kick upon the opponent.  Such
blows have enough force to crack skulls, crush ribs and destroy organs, all
while carrying the martial artist across the room.  A jump kick inflicts
bashing kicking damage plus two dice.  However, the difficulty to block,
dodge or otherwise counter such a maneuver is reduced by two.

Killing Blows: A study of anatomy and a careful use of chambering and force
allows the skilled martial artist to inflict devastating injury on his
opponents, possibly killing them with single blows.  Killing blows inflict
lethal damage.  No special roll or expenditure is required; the martial
artist may simply decide to score lethal damage instead of bashing damage
with his attacks - Killing blows may not be effective against non-human
opponents, at the Storyteller's discretion. (After all, where are the vital
spots on a bakemono?).

Ripping Strike: Used primarily with the Tiger Claw and Eagle Claw
techniques, a ripping strike rakes across the victim with stiffened fingers
bent into a claw-like grasp.  The martial artist may strike with the palm
of his hand, or even rip into the opponent's flesh.  A ripping strike
inflicts normal damage.  However, such attacks are quite painful if
executed successfully, and thus, cause the opponent to lose one from her
dice pools for the remainder of the turn and in the following turn due to
the pain - At the Storyteller's discretion, a properly executed ripping
strike of significant damage (five or more health levels) may actually tear
out ears, eyes or chunks of skin.


Additional Soft Techniques-- requires a Martial Arts score of at least 4.

Acrobatic Dodge: Leaps, gyrations and flips allow a fast martial artist to
evade many blows.  Back flips and elegant jumps are the hallmarks of such
stylists, and they deftly avoid the strikes of many opponents.  By jumping,
flipping,  bending and spinning, an  acrobatic martial artist may evade
many blows at once.  The martial artist uses Dex + Dodge as normal, but may
dodge a number of hand-to-hand or melee attacks equal to his Acrobatics
rating while using his full Dodge pool for each (as if evading).  Executing
an acrobatic dodge requires the entire turn - a martial artist cannot split
his dice pool or perform an acrobatic dodge in conjunction with powers such
as Rage or Hyper-Speed.

Cataleptic Grapple: With a proper locking hold, a grappling martial artist
can apply pressure to blood vessels, the diaphragm, lungs, or simply against
specific pressure points.  In any case, the results are similar - the
victim lapses into unconsciousness.  A cataleptic grapple requires a
successful grapple first; the martial artist must have a secure hold on
the opponent.  Then the martial artist must roll Perception + Martial Arts
(difficulty  7); this is an extended roll, with each success inflicting one
level of unsoakable bashing damage.  As long as the martial artist keeps
the hold, he can continue to apply pressure, stunning the opponent and even
eventually killing her.  As always, once the opponent is taken to the
Incapacitated health level, she lapses into unconsciousness.  Cataleptic
grapples have no effect on Western Kindred.

Push Hands: Practice in Tai Chi includes "push hands," a game wherein the
stylists press against one another in special poses while trying to force
the opponent off-balance.  A skilled practitioner learns to read body
language, anticipate motion and shift balance with subtle pressure.  When a
stylist with push hands is attacked, the martial artist may defend with
this technique.  The player rolls a normal block, but with difficulty 7. If
successful, the attacker is knocked to the ground, suffering a number of
dice of bashing damage equal to his or her strength (automatic strength
successes from Potence, etc. do count for this) while the Tai Chi master
sidesteps and simply gives the foe a little nudge.

Reactive Strikes: Parrying, pushing and riposting in rapid succession, the
martial artist seizes a brief opening to come in under the opponent's
guard.  When using a reactive strike, the martial artist must split his
dice pool or otherwise perform at least two actions in the turn.  The first
action must block the opponent's attack; failure on the block negates the
reactive strike.  However, if the block succeeds, the martial artist
immediately counterstrikes; the reactive blow can not be dodged or blocked.

Spinning Throw: By using momentum against several striking or grappling
opponents at once, a master can turn a series of attackers into a mass of
flying bodies.  This defensive maneuver pits the weight and motion of each
attacker against the others, so that they all assist in the task of
flinging the aggressors away from the defending stylist.  A spinning throw
is a reactive throw; the martial artist must be attacked or grappled to use
this ability.  Effectively, the spinning throw allows the stylist to throw
multiple opponents without suffering a penalty for multiple actions.  The
opponents must attack first, but resolution of damage is delayed until the
martial artist attempts the spinning throw.  The martial artist then makes
one roll to throw at the usual difficulty, with a + 1 difficulty for each
attacker beyond the first - difficulties exceeding 10 remain at 10, but
each additional point removes a success from the final roll.  The throwing
player compares his successes with the attacks of the aggressors; if an
attacker scores more successes, his attack inflicts regular results, while
in case of a tie, the attacker fails in his strike, but is not thrown.  For
example, if five foolish Kin-jin attack Hideo, he can declare that he is
attempting a spinning throw, and then wait  for the Cainites to attack.  He
rolls to throw once, at a difficulty of 6 (soft style) +4 (for the first
four Cainites) and losing one success from the roll (for the last Kin-jin).
Hideo's player rolls and scores four successes; one is removed for the
extra attacker, leaving him with three successes.  Any attacker with only
two successes to strike is thrown; those with three successes fail to hit;
those with four or more strike Hideo normally.


Appendix Two: Optional Firearms Rules

One: Firearms do not add successes on the roll to hit to the damage pool.
Bullets do most of their damage through a combination of kinetic force and
expansion-induced hydrostatic shock. Without these two factors, even a
bullet in the brain or other vital organ won't always kill.

Two: All firearms difficulties are 6, modified by situation and recoil.

Three: There is no longer a single firearms skill. It is now broken down
into the following series of subskills:

Handgun: Used for both revolvers and semi-automatic weapons, including
burst and autofire capable machine pistols.

Rifle: Used for long arms. Includes everything from bolt-action hunting
rifles to military assault weapons. Also covers carbines (shorter weapons
firing rifle rounds).

Shotgun: Used for shotgun weapons, regardless of length or ammunition type
(i.e. both shot shells and slugs).

SMG: Used to cover sub-machine guns; weapons which look more like a rifle,
but fire pistol ammunition, and usually being capable of three-round bursts
and/or automatic fire.

Machine Gun: Weapons firing rifle (or heavier) rounds. These are built on
heavier frames than a rifle; many of them being too heavy for a person to
carry, and capable of higher rates of fire than an assault rifle.

Artillery, rocket launchers and other weapons such as these use their own
rules, and fall under different skills. Grenade launchers being used for
direct fire are handled with the rifle skill.

Four: Weapons have an effective combat range much shorter than their
maximum range. The following list covers the combat range of each type of
weapon:

Handguns: 15 metres
Rifles: 50 metres
Shotguns: 10 metres
SMGs: 15 metres
Machine Guns: 50 metres
A cumulative penalty of +1 to difficulty is added for each increment of
these ranges over the effective ranges. So a handgun is at +1 difficulty
from 16 - 30 metres, +2 from 31 - 45 metres etc.

Firearms Damage
Due to the Storyteller system's method of handling damage, it becomes
impractical to assign damage based on the specific caliber of a weapon.
Instead, firearms will fall into classifications within their type. Each
class with list the amount of damage it does, along with the Strength
requirements to use the weapon without penalty.

Handguns:
Strength requirement is increased by 1 if the weapon is fired one-handed
(i.e. not held in a two-handed combat grip such as the Weaver stance). Even
in a two-handed grip, a handgun's Strength requirement is one higher than a
rifle of equivalent damage.
Very Light Damage: 2    Str Requirement: 1*
Light Damage: 3         Str Requirement: 1
Medium Damage: 4        Str Requirement: 2
Heavy: Damage: 5        Str Requirement: 3
* Very light handguns can be fired one handed without an increase in the
Strength requirement.

Machine Pistols
Strength requirement is increased by 1 if the weapon is fired one-handed
(i.e. not held in a two-handed combat grip such as the Weaver stance).
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. Even in a two-handed grip,
a machine pistol's Strength requirement is one higher than a rifle of
equivalent damage.
Very Light Damage: 2   Str Requirement: 1*
Light Damage: 3        Str Requirement: 1
Medium Damage: 4       Str Requirement: 2
Heavy: Damage: 5       Str Requirement: 3
* Very light machine pistols can be fired one handed without an increase in
the Strength requirement.

SMGs
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. It increases by 1 if the
weapon is fired one-handed. SMGs get a one point decrease to their Strength
requirement, (for single shots _only_ ) if the weapon features a stock.
Light Damage: 3         Str Requirement: 1
Medium Damage: 4        Str Requirement: 2
Heavy Damage: 5         Str Requirement: 3

Rifles
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. It increases by 1 if the
weapon lacks a stock, and by 2 if the weapon is fired one-handed.
Light Damage: 5         Str Requirement: 2
Medium Damage: 6        Str Requirement: 3
Heavy Damage: 7         Str Requirement: 4
Very Heavy Damage: 8    Str Requirement: 5
Super Heavy Damage: 9   Str Requirement: 6

Carbines
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. It increases by 1 if the
weapon lacks a stock, and by 2 if the weapon is fired one-handed. Carbines
fire rifle rounds, but feature shorter barrels etc. This increases
portability etc., but results in a decrease in damage without
necessarily decreasing recoil.
Light Damage: 4         Str Requirement: 2
Medium Damage: 5        Str Requirement: 3
Heavy Damage: 6         Str Requirement: 4
Very Heavy Damage: 7    Str Requirement: 5
Super Heavy Damage: 8   Str Requirement: 6

Shotguns
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. It increases by 1 if the
weapon lacks a stock, and by 2 if the weapon is fired one-handed.
Light Damage: 5         Str Requirement: 2
Medium Damage: 7        Str Requirement: 3
Heavy Damage: 9         Str Requirement: 4
Very Heavy Damage: 10   Str Requirement: 5

Machine Guns
Strength requirement increased by 1 when firing three-round bursts. For
autofire, it increases by 1 per 5 rounds fired. It increases by 1 if the
weapon lacks a stock, and by 2 if the weapon is fired one-handed.
Medium Damage: 6        Str Requirement: 3
Heavy Damage: 7         Str Requirement: 4
Very Heavy Damage: 8    Str Requirement: 5
Super Heavy Damage: 9   Str Requirement: 6
Mega Heavy Damage: 10   Str Requirement: 7

Recoil Penalties
Each weapon class has a minimum Strength requirement included in its
information. This represents the amount of Strength needed to effectively
control the gun and its recoil while firing. For each point of difference
between the firing character's Strength and the gun's requirement, the
difficulty to hit increases by 1. If the difference is more than 2 points,
than the character must make a Dexterity check (diff. 6 + 1 per point of
difference) to avoid dropping the weapon. In addition, the character must
soak one Health Level of Bashing damage per point of difference (so a Str 3
character firing a Heavy rifle must soak one level of damage).

Note that certain circumstances can alter the required Strength of a
weapon. So just because someone can fire that machine gun fine on three
round bursts doesn't mean he can handle it when it's time to rock and roll.

Multiple Shots
Provided they hold more than one round of ammunition, weapons with a rate
of fire of one can still be fired more than once in a round. However, it
requires splitting the dice pool as per normal rules. In addition each shot
after the first suffers a cumulative +1 to difficulty.

Weapons with a rate of fire higher than one, but not capable of three-round
bursts or automatic fire, may be fired up to their rate of fire without
splitting the dice pool. Each shot after the first suffers a cumulative +1
difficulty. Also, the total number of successes must equal the shot being
fired, and you may never fire a number of shots greater than the total pool
you have to hit. 

Example: Bob's character fires three shots from his customized hand cannon.
Bob rolls his Dex + Handgun pool of 5 dice, and gets a 6,7,7,3,4. The
initial difficulty for Bob's shot is 6, and he totaled three successes, so
the first bullet hits. The difficulty for the second shot is 7. Checking
his results, Bob has two successes, so the second shot hit. But the third
shot would have been difficulty 8; meaning Bob would have had to have
rolled at least three 8s in order for the shot to hit. This doesn't mean
Bob need three 8s, two 7s and a 6 to hit; successes apply to all shots, so
had he rolled 8,8,8,4,2 all his shots would have been on target. (So taking
the example farther, he would have to have rolled at least four 9s to hit
with a fourth shot, and five 10s to hit with a fifth. He could not make a
sixth shot regardless of the weapon's rate of fire, since the total dice
pool was only five dice.) 

_Note_: Due to the time it takes these weapons to cycle, dice pools may not
be split to allow the weapon to be fired again in the same round.

Three-round bursts are calculated similar to multiple shots. However, you
receive two extra dice to add to your pool when firing in this way. Also,
the difficulty of the first shot is at +1; the second and third shots are
both at +2. However, the number of successes is still the same, so it
requires a total of three successes for the third shot to hit. You may
split your dice pool to fire more than one three-round burst during a
single round.

Autofire is calculated differently from a three-round burst. You receive
five dice to add to your pool, regardless of how many rounds you are
firing. The first shot is at +1 difficulty, the second and third are at +2,
the fourth and fifth at +3 etc. The difficulty stops rising when it reaches
ten; you may continue to fire rounds even after the (autofire only)
modifiers would normally push it past this number. 

Just as with all other modes of fire, the number of accumulated successes
must equal the current shot being fired (so to score a hits with shots six
and seven of an autofire would require six and seven successes at
difficulty 10). Even if you are emptying a weapon's clip, you may never hit
your target with more bullets than you have dice in your pool to hit. You
may _not_ split your dice pool to use a weapon on autofire more than once
in a single round.

Weapons being fired in this way can also be used to make spray attacks. 
All targets must be within one metre of each other (you can fire at four
targets, each a metre apart; you just have to work over them in sequence).

Nominate all targets before rolling, and declare how many bullets/which
order you're firing at them in (i.e. Target One gets the first bullet, Two
gets shots two and three, Three gets four through seven etc.). Roll your
attack as per normal, and calculate hits as per normal, with the following
exceptions:

A: The basic difficulty for the attack is 5, rather than 6; modified by
automatic fire penalties as normal.

B: Each bullet after the first requires one more success than normal to
score a hit. So bullet two needs three success, bullet three needs four
etc.

Autofire weapons can also be used to create zones of suppressive fire. The
base difficulty to cross through an area covered by suppressive fire is 6.
This difficulty goes up by one for every five bullets fired into a one metre
area. Each metre crossed requires a new roll. Failing a roll means you catch
one bullet for each point the roll was failed by (calculate based on the
highest failing die). Botching the roll means you soak up all the bullets
in that area; at least your friends won't get hit. Thanks, Mr.
Bulletshield! There is no roll to hit associated with this attack; since
the point is to try and make folks keep their heads down, rather than
trying to hit targets.

Example: With 50 bullets, you could create an area five metres long that is
difficulty 8 to cross.

You _do_ get the five extra dice for autofire when shooting in this manner.

You may _not_ split your dice pool to use a weapon on autofire more than
once in a single round.

Remember the golden rule of multiple shots: Whether splitting your pool, or
using another form of multiple shots, you may never fire/hit with more
rounds than the number of total dice in your pool to hit.

And the golden rule of firearms damage: No matter how many shots you hit
with, each one is soaked as a separate source of damage.

The Stuff That Happens When You Miss
Just because you miss your shot doesn't mean the bullet doesn't go
somewhere. Stray rounds have a chance to perforate friends, enemies and
innocent bystanders.

When a shot is missed, the first thing the Storyteller should do is
calculate what targets may be in the line of fire (suggested range is
within a metre to either side/behind the intended target). Next she should
consult the handy chart below:

Single round: 1
Three-round burst: 1
Enclosed area less than two metres wide: +1
Dice pool split to fire multiple three-round bursts: +1 per extra burst
Automatic fire: 1 +1 per 10 rounds
Automatic fire in enclosed area less than two metres wide: 1 - 2 +1 per 10
rounds**
Spraying: +1
Shotgun (firing shot): 1 - 2*
Shotgun (firing shot) in area less than two metres wide: 1 - 3**
* Automatic shotguns are 1 - 2 and +1 per 10 rounds as per normal automatic
fire.
** These listings already have the enclosed area modifier added due to
their nature.

After checking the chart, the Storyteller rolls a die for each stray
bullet. If the result comes up one of the numbers indicated on the table;
Mr. Pedestrian is about to get free lead-supplied air conditioning. The
person who originally fired the shot rolls damage against the new target.

While this system is more realistic than the "disappearing bullet" style of
play, it can tend to slow things down; especially when a lot of lead (10+
strays) are flying around at once. Storytellers may wish to speed things up
by checking for a hit the same as normal; only instead of doing it once per
bullet, each time someone is hit, roll a second die to determine the number
of stray rounds they catch.

Merciful STs may wish to use this method, and divide the result by two.

Shotguns
These weapons are designed to produce big nasty wounds in soft squishy
targets. The standard shotgun load is a plastic shell filled either with
smaller (birdshot) or larger (buckshot) lead pellets. These come out of the
gun in a tight group, and spread out over distance. At close ranges, the
amount of damage they can cause a target is devastating.

As a group of shotgun pellets spread, they are capable of hitting more
targets; however, they do less damage to each individual target as a
result. All distances and measurements on the following table are in metres.

Range     Pattern Size     Damage Modifier
1 - 5        0*                None
6 - 10       1                  -1
11 - 15      2                  -2
15 - 20      2                  -3
21 - 25      3                  -3
26 - 30      3                  -4
* Can only hit one target

After 30 metres, the shotgun loses one Health Level of damage per metre, and
the pattern remains at three metres wide. All targets within the listed
spread are caught, and take the listed damage (subtract the damage modifier
from the weapon's normal damage). Anything is between the path of a shotgun
and its intended target, anything behind that target is considered safe.

Even if it would have damage remaining, a shotgun ceases to do damage once
the shot has reached a total distance of 60 metres.

Buckshot adds one Health Level to the weapon's damage, but reduce all
spread sizes to the next lowest category. Damage reduction remains the
same.

Sawn-off shotguns double the listed spread size, but halve the range. So at
15 metres, the pattern had spread to three metres wide. A sawn-off shotgun
ceases doing damage at 30 metres.

Shotguns have one additional drawback; soak dice from armor count double
against them. To get around this, the weapon may instead fire a solid slug.
These do once less level of damage than normal, but have normal range; most
importantly, armor does not count double against them. 


Appendix Two (B): Optional Linguistics Rules

The linguistics knowledge offers working use of languages as follows:

Rank one: one extra language
Rank two: one additional language
Rank three: two additional languages
Rank four: three additional languages
Rank five: four additional languages

Thus, at Linguistics ¥¥¥¥, the mutant speaks and/or reads eight languages
(her native tongue, plus seven from the ability).

Knowledge of a dead language will frequently decrease the difficulty to
puzzle out the meaning of passages written or spoken in languages directly
derived from it, usually by one.

The mutant may also make an Intelligence + Linguistics roll (difficulty 7)
to puzzle out individual words in a language that he does not speak, so
long as he does speak a closely related language (for example, the mutant
speaks French.  This allows him to scan other Romance languages, such as
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and English.  Speaking Dutch would allow him
to try to scan other Germanic Languages, such as German, English, Danish,
Swedish, and Norwegian.  Speaking Ukrainian would allow attempts at
scanning Slavic languages such as Russian, Polish, and Serbian).  Each
success suggests to the mutant the meaning of one word in any given
sentence or phrase.


Appendix Three: Terms, Slang, and Major Groups

	Acolytes of Magneto- unsurprisingly founded and led by Magneto (but
some would claim that Fabian Cortez truly founded the group), this
team was assembled to establish a safe haven for all mutants away
from humanity, even if they had to fight humanity to get it.
	Age of Apocalypse- an alternate timeline in which Charles Xavier
did not exist to check the ambitions of Apocalypse, and Magneto was
the founding father of the X-Men, in Xavier's memory.
	Black Air- a nasty British black ops and counter-intel agency
that vies with Department H for the title of "right evil bastards".  
Pete Wisdom of Excalibur is a former member.
	Body Shoppe- an interdimensional chop-shop that redesigns and
refits a being's genetic structure and phenotype to order, usually in
a painful fashion.  It is run by Spiral.
	Brotherhood- a mutant group led by Havok, though it is possible
that he was being manipulated by the Dark Beast.  They existed to 'take 
the power back' from humans and make sure that mutantkind was not 
threatened by paranoid humans.
	Brotherhood of Evil Mutants- several teams have borne this name
throughout mutant history.  Most of them have been led by Magneto,
though Mystique and Toad have also had that honour.  They existed
largely to fight the X-Men and win a place for mutants at the expense
of humans.
	Clan Askani- a group of people in the future dedicated to the
opposition of Apocalypse.  Led by Rachel Summers as the Mother Askani,
it produced Stryfe (oops!) and aided Cable.
	Days of Future Past- a possible future in which Sentinels rule
the Earth and have defeated the X-Men, killing some and putting
others into internment camps.  Normal humans are scarcely better off.
	Department H- a rather nasty organization in the government of
Canada that spawned the Weapon X program, Alpha Flight, and other such
programs.  They are probably the most evil government department in
the Marvel Universe.
	Domina- the leader of a particular group of Neo (q.v.).  Perhaps 
usually female.
	Emplates- a group of semi-vampiric mutants that feed off of the
genetic 'marrow' of other mutants, and spread their condition in so
doing.  They killed Shard.  Their founder would appear to be
Marius St. Croix, the brother of Generation X's M.
	Excalibur- a team of mutants led by Nightcrawler, that deals with
mutant issues on an international scale.  Based in Great Britain, on
Muir Island.  Many former X-Men are on the team.
	Ex-humed- a group of mutants that had been killed in various
ways but restored to a mockery of life to plague the X.S.E. in the
future.
	Fastball Special- a combat maneuver developed by Wolverine and
Colossus of the X-Men, and recently executed with style by
Marrow and Maggott.
	Fatal Attractions- a famous storyline that had far-reaching
effects for Marvel's mutants: Magneto was at the zenith of his
power and threatened the Earth.  Wolverine lost his adamantium.
Xavier erased Magneto's mind- creating Onslaught (q.v.) in the
process.  Colossus first betrayed the X-Men, then the Acolytes-
ruining his relationship with Shadowcat.
	Flatscan- Normal human (derogatory).
	Four Horsemen (Dark Riders)- a group of powerful mutants that
have been assembled by Apocalypse to be his Harbingers.  Notable
former members include Archangel and Caliban the Hound.
	Gene Nation- a team of mutants once led by the Dark Beast and
composed largely of ex-Morlocks.  They had some connection with
Mikhail Rasputin as well.  They were violently anti-human.
	Genejoke- and insult that implies that a mutant (or human) is
ineffectual or pathetic to a humorous degree because of his or her
genetic makeup.
	Generation X- a team of young mutants founded and led by Banshee
and the White Queen.  Composed of some of the most powerful mutants on
the planet, Gen-X was created to teach them how to use their powers.
It is expected that the members of Gen-X will eventually 'graduate' to
one of the adult teams.
	Genosha- an island nation with a formerly rabidly anti-mutant 
government.  Now controlled by Magneto and his Acolytes (q.v.).  
See 'mutate'.
	Halfscan- idiotic and/or low-powered mutant.
	Hand- a group of ninja that have dark and mysterious purposes.
They especially dislike Wolverine and Psylocke.  They claim to be
able to bring people back from the dead- apparently doing this to
restore Elektra.
	Hellfire Club- a social club founded in early modern England that
has survived to the present day.  It has an 'inner circle', a sort of
executive, that is led by mutants of the most evil sort.  They are
all fabulously wealthy and mean to rule the world, by hook or crook.
	Hound Program- an institution that existed in Days of Future Past 
(q.v.) and has just been started up in the present.  It consists of 
special brainwashed mutants (the Hounds) that hunt down other mutants.
Sabretooth, Rachel Summers, and Psi-lord are all prominent Hounds.
	Inferno- an event that was associated with the corruption of both
Illyana Rasputin (Magik) and Madelyne Prior (the Goblyn Queen)- the
invasion of Earth by demonic entities.
	Jaeger- the battle leader of a group of Neo (q.v.), and the dominant
male, he must still take orders from the Domina.
	Landau, Luckman, and Lake- a banking firm(?) with interdimensional
interests.  They have several powerful operatives and an immense resource
base.  L,L,& L seem most interested in Wolverine and Deadpool- who are
both Weapon X alumni, curiously enough.
	Legacy Virus- a deadly disease that was introduced to the twentieth
century by Stryfe.  So far, it has proved to be lethal to mutants, and
a normal human has caught it as well.  The victim loses control of his
powers.  The Dark Beast has engineered an 'all-human' version of the
virus.  Either Cable or Douglock is supposed to have the key to stopping
it.
	Limbo- an alternate dimension (or sub-dimension) where time and
space relate to each other in bizarre ways.  Magik, while she lived, was
the ruler of Limbo.
	Marauders- a team of mutants founded and led by Mr. Sinister, though
it was Scalphunter who led them in the field.  They were assembled for
the expressed purpose of killing Morlocks.  They have been killed
several times, but cloned and brought back in that sense by Sinister
on several occasions.  Team membership included Prism, Arclight,
Harpoon, Scalphunter, Malice, Sabretooth, Riptide, Blockbuster, Vertigo,
and Scrambler.
	Master Mold- a special Sentinel (q.v.) whose sole purpose is the
construction and control of other Sentinels.
	Mojoverse- an exceedingly irritating dimension which is ruled by
the evil television executive, Mojo, for the purposes of making bad
television for trillions of bored viewers.  Mojo is the evil 'genius'
responsible for the creation of the X-Babies.  The Mojoverse may be
ruled by Dazzler and Longshot at the moment.
	Morlocks- a group of mutants dwelling in a tunnel system underneath
New York City that extends for miles.  Lead variously by Storm, Mikhail
Rasputin, the Dark Beast, Callisto, and Masque (split by faction and by
time span- confusing, I know).  Most are physically mutated in some
obvious way which prevents them from being accepted.  One of them
(Marrow) became an X-Man.
	Morlock Massacre- also known as the Mutant Massacre.  Perpetrated
by the Marauders against the Morlocks at the behest of Mr. Sinister,
this event resulted in the deaths of dozens of Morlocks and the loss of
Angel's wings.  It has recently been revealed that Gambit led the
Marauders into the tunnels.
	Mutant Liberation Front (MLF)- a terrorist group of mutants, founded
by Stryfe, that 'stirs the pot' of human-mutant relations.  This team
included such nasties as Stryfe, Mirage, Locus, Reignfire, and Forearm
among others.
	Mutate- 1. a mutant that has been altered by the Genengineer of 
Genosha. The subject usually loses his free will, but may have his Powers 
augmented.	2. a normal human or other creature that has been altered to 
resemble a mutant in powers and even physiology- for example, Vertigo of 
the Marauders.
	Mutie- Mutant (derogatory).
	Nanite- a single-purpose nanotech robot- which may be able to perform
multiple complex tasks in execution of that purpose.
	Nanotech- as adjective or noun, applicable to any high-tech piece of
equipment that is incredibly small.
	Neo- a group of uber-mutants that seem to have a remarkably pliant
x-factor expression and a group unconscious.  They are a warrior race,
consisting of such factions as the Shockwave Riders and the Lost Souls.
	New Mutants- a team of young mutants founded and led by Charles
Francis Xavier.  The precursor of Generation X, the team was led in the
field by Cannonball, Karma, and Moonstar on various occasions.
	N'garai- a race of demons from another dimension who enter Earth's
dimension through the use of a portal (shaped like a caern) that can
be erected in any place where the 'skin' between the dimensions is
thin- like in the Mansion's backyard.  They are bent on invading this
dimension and using its resources- killing everyone to do it, if
necessary.  Recently, the N'garai have been all but exterminated by a 
new demon race, the Ru'tai.
	Nimrod Sentinel- see Sentinel.  A special Sentinel that had the
powers of free will and cognition, which made it extremely dangerous.
Supposed to be dead, until it was revealed that Bastion is Nimrod.
	Onslaught- an event in which a being of the same name, composed
of the psychic residue of Prof. X and Magneto, attacked the entire
world and apparently killed the Heroes (Fantastic Four, Avengers, 
etc.).
	Operation: Zero Tolerance- a government-sponsored organization,
privately led by a semi-Sentinel named Bastion, that was nominally
dedicated to the destruction of all mutants but whose actual purpose
remains unclear.
	Phalanx- a deadly techno-organic (q.v.) alien race that seeks to
absorb all life forms into its collective soul.  It can do this simply
by touching a prospective victim.
	Phoenix- 1. a powerful, universal force of creation and destruction
that is mysteriously linked to Jean Grey.  It masqueraded as her for
some time, and eventually became such a threat as it became corrupted
by human emotions that the Shi'ar (q.v.) ordered the death of its 
mortal seeming.  The corrupt Phoenix is called Dark Phoenix.  2. Either
of the two mutants that have taken the name- Jean Grey or Rachel Summers.
	Prime Sentinel- see Sentinel.  A normal human that has been infected
with nanotech to make him into a 'sleeper' Sentinel.
	Reavers- a group of cyborgs assembled by Donald Pierce, they were
the X-Men's main opponents in Australia.  Notable Reavers included
Lady Deathstrike, Skullbuster, Prettyboy, Pierce, and diverse others.
	The Right- a fanatical group of mutant-hating humans with government
ties.  Their founder is Cameron Hodge.
	Ru'tai- the new and improved demonic replacements for the N'garai.
They are led in their quest to understand Earth (through dissection) by
Pilgrimm.
	Sentinel- a large mutant-hunting robot that works for the government 
(most of the time).
	Shi'ar- a powerful alien race that has an intergalactic empire.  The
current Majestrix of the Imperium, Lillandra Neramani, is romantically
linked to Xavier, and much of the special technology of the X-Men comes
from the Shi'ar.
	SHIELD- Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate
(at least at the moment- this can change without notice).  It is either
an international or an American body dedicated to fighting terrorism and
fascism wherever it may dwell.  It is usually (but not always) headed by
Nick Fury.
	Spike- derogatory term for normal mutants by the Neo (q.v.)
	Team X- a group of mutants working for the American government during
the Cold War, they were mostly 'on loan' from the Canadian government.
Team X included mutants that were to become Wolverine, Sabretooth, Wraith,
Maverick, and Mystique.  Strictly Black Ops.
	Techno-Organic- descriptive of any sort of normally inorganic material
that supports life through a combination of biology and technology.
	Weapon X- a program (or a mutant of that program) created by the C.I.A.
for the purpose of creating Canadian 'super-soldiers'.  It spawned such
notables as Sabretooth and Wolverine.
	X-Corps- a paramilitary team of mutants founded by Banshee.
	X-Factor- 1. a team of mutants originally composed of the first X-Men
but now led by Havok.  For a long period in its history, it was an arm
of the U.S. government but has since been forced underground.
	X-Factor- 2. the cluster of stations that distinguish a mutant
genetically, or the power that derives therefrom.
	X-Factor- 3. the random element in any equation or model that makes
prediction of the results problematic.
	X-Force- a team of mutants founded and led by Cable as a para-
military mutant police force that is constantly ready to fight 'evil
mutants' and evil humans, if necessary.  It evolved out of the New
Mutants.  Cable has since left the team.
	X-Men- a team of mutants founded and led by Charles Francis Xavier
for the purpose of teaching mutants how to use their powers effectively
and constructively.  It has evolved into a mutant-policing force that
battles so-called 'evil mutants'.
	X-Statix- a 'celebrity' team of mutants operating in the mold of
reality television.
	Xavier School Enforcers (X.S.E.)- also the Xavier Security Enforcers-
a mutant police force from some time in the future; it presumably
evolved from X-Factor.  It produced such mutant notables as Shard and
Bishop.
	Xavier's Underground Enforcers (X.U.E.)- traitors to the X.S.E.
that want to send their members back in time to prevent their present
from becoming the world's future.  Membership includes Archer, 
Fixx, Greystone, Shard- and just possibly Forge.

Appendix Four: Attribute information

A mutant with exceptional strength can engage in amazing feats that can
only be dreamed of by mortal men.  This is scaled more heroically than
the information in Werewolf and Vampire; when crossing over, I allow the
supernatural creatures to lift and smash the way that mutants can.  A
being with a supernatural Wits score has supernatural reflexes, and can
perform feats such as side-stepping gunfire.  Note that Mega-Attributes
are included in this pool when making calculations.

Strength + Might = Six: Max press one ton
Seven: five tons
Eight: ten tons
Nine: forty tons
Ten: fifty tons
Eleven: sixty tons
Twelve: seventy tons
Thirteen: eighty tons
Fourteen: ninety tons
Fifteen: one hundred tons

Wits 6: Split dice pool three ways
Seven: Dodge (rather than evade) gunfire
Eight: Split dice pool four ways
Ten: Abort any action without penalty

The concepts for many powers, merits, and other tidbits were borrowed from
TSR's Marvel Superheroes Roleplaying Game, Palladium's Heroes Unlimited,
White Wolf's new Aberrant game, and some other systems- even TV shows.
Obviously, the main framework for the game mechanics is that of the
Storyteller system, developed by the White Wolf Game Studio. 'Local' game
mechanics and game balance came from my own twisted brain. Net resources
and e-mail suggestions were invaluable in the development of this
supplement.  The Poet would especially like to thank Scott Clay, Keith

Appendix Six: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

A Power that I wish to get for my character is listed as being of more
that one category (e.g., Physical/Mental).  What is the experience cost?

	Take the experience cost that is the most favourable for your
	character. If your character has Physical as his primary category and
	Mental as his tertiary, then the choice is obvious.  Note that
	sometimes this changes slightly how the Power works-- see below.

How can Altered Perceptions be Physical, Social, and Mental?  They would
seem to me to be Physical.

	An Altered Perceptions works as a Physical power does so because your
	eyes (or ears, etc.) are built differently.  They can work as a Mental
	power in a sort of pseudo-Telepathic way.  Your mind is actually
	gathering the data, not your body.  The Social version works as a
	combination of the two approaches.

How much does a new Tertiary Power cost?

	Fifteen points for the first Rank.

What does it cost if I buy Invisibility (a four-Rank Power) with Experience
points?

	OK.  First, let's assume that Social is your primary category.  You
	would need to spend a total of 46 Experience to pick it up- ten points
	for the first Rank, six for the second, twelve for the third, and
	eighteen for the fourth.  Yes, you would need to spend all of this
	Experience at once, unless the ST lets you pay it in installments.  If
	Social was your secondary category, it would cost 10 + 8 + 16 + 24 or
	58 points.

How about a multi-Rank tertiary Power?
	
	Normally, you can't get a multi-Rank tertiary Power.  If your ST is
	inclined to allow it, I suggest a cost of at least 8 x current, if not
	10 x current.  I'd incline more to the latter course.  So, in the case
	of Invisibility, the cost would be 15 + 10 + 20 + 30 or 75 points.  In
	any case, you can't improve a tertiary Power with Experience, so if
	your ST allows you to buy a multi-Rank Power like Invisibility or
	Technomorphing, consider yourself lucky.

Can a Tertiary Power be improved?  If yes, how and when?
	
	Almost never.  An exception to this is Extra Health Levels.  You can
	buy a new tertiary Power when given the option, but you can't improve
	it once you buy it.

When I buy a tertiary Power, can I buy more than one Rank?  I know that I
can't improve it once I've got it.

	Well, using Mass-Shifting (Increase) as an example... you want to be
	able to buy two or more Ranks of it in one go, since you won't be able
	to improve it after you've got it.  I certainly wouldn't allow it, no.
	You're stuck with the first Rank of it.  All right, the example was
	superfluous.

Can I change what my primary, secondary, and tertiary Power categories are?

	Not conventionally, no.  Your Storyteller may allow some earth-shaking
	campaign event to do so.  For instance, in the Muir Island saga,
	Polaris was a physical character, whereas she is normally social.

If you have an exclusive Power (marked) with ** you can only have hyper-
abilities and mega-attributes; but can you develop other Powers via stunts
of the mega-attributes?

	Yes, you can. Note the exception to this (Autumn Force), in which
	even if you had other Powers, none of them would work.

...and if you lose a Power do you also lose the Power developed from it?

	Not automatically. If you developed Hyper-Scholarship from Mega-Int and
	lost your Mega-Int somehow, you'd still have your Hyper-Scholarship
	unless the same thing that took away your Mega-Int took it away too.

If Physical is my tertiary category, but I bought Extra Health Levels at the
start of my character's life, can I buy any more?

	Yes.  This is the sole exception to the rule that you can't improve a
	tertiary Power.  However, they cost 15 for you.  Remember that your
	character's Stamina is the cap on the number of extra Health Levels
	you can get.

Can I buy Mega-Attribute power stunts if I've improved an attribute to six
or more without buying the Power?

	Nope.

Don't you think that Physical characters are sort of weak compared to Mental
and Social characters?

	Tell that to Wolverine and the Hulk.  Paradoxically, we've found that
	you have to be smarter to play a high-level Physical character than a
	high-level Mental one.  At low levels, the Physical characters are the
	strongest.  At the highest levels, the Mental characters are the
	strongest.  Social characters are engines of destruction the whole way
	through.

If a stunt implies that a Power may be purchased as a Power Stunt (e.g.,
Cosmic Awareness may be purchased as a Power Stunt to Telesthesia), is it
really as cheap as 3xp (5 for Secondary)?

	Nope.  Sorry.  It's really as cheap as 10 exp for the first Rank (or
	15 if it's a Tertiary Power).  You do have the spend the Willpower to
	develop it.  I personally don't charge the additional 3, 5, or 7 exp
	for the stunt.

I'm confused.  How does Hyper-Speed work?

	Hyper-Speed just lets you run really quickly, and buy lots of nifty
	Power Stunts, unless you're willing to spend Power Charge.  In that
	case, you can also get extra actions by spending a point of Power
	Charge.  One point will get your character his Rank in actions (total)
	per round, so if your mutant has Rank three Hyper-Speed, he can take
	three actions that round (or fewer, if desired).

Can Nemesis Power or Power Mimicry be duplicated with Power Duplication?

	Excellent question.  No.  First, you can't duplicate an exclusive
	Power (like Autumn Force, Domina Power, Nemesis Power, or Power
	Duplication itself), nor can you mimic it with Power Mimicry.
	It's a little more reasonable to allow Power Mimicry or Power 
	Absorption to be duplicated, but I personally wouldn't allow it.

A mutant with Power Duplication can buy stunts for the Powers she has
duplicated, can't she?

	Yes.
	
...but can she take stunts for them that would allow her to buy other 
Powers?

	Not unless the stunt in question is from a Power that has been
	Perma-Burned using the stunt of the same name.

If one person in a Life Gestalt has Conditional Immortality, does that
Power affect the whole group?
	
	No.  Just that person.  Even someone with Conditional Immortality can
	lose his last Health Level-- it just won't kill her.  Everyone else in
	the group will die when all the Gestalt Health Levels are gone.  The
	person with Conditional Immortality will come out of it a while later. 
	That is, unless whatever took her last Health Level her was her 
	weakness, and it struck her directly.
	
	Even if someone in a Life Gestalt was killed with the thing that is
	the weakness of someone else with Conditional Immortality, the person
	with Conditional Immortality will not die, but just drop as usual.
	
	The best optional Power for people with Life Gestalt, obviously, is
	Extra Health Levels.  That helps everybody.  Note that the Health
	Levels for Body Armour are not shared.

Do I have to spend Power Charge whenever I want to use my Power?

	Nope.  You never have to spend Power Charge if you don't want to.  You
	might lose a point of it when you botch a roll to use an Active power,
	though.  Some specialized uses of your Power (through Stunts, or if you
	want to get an extra action from Hyper-Speed, etc.) may require such
	an expenditure.

How fast does my character recover Health (Willpower, Power Charge, etc.)?
	
	See the Advantages and Health section, sandwiched between the Experience
	section and the appendices.

Can you explain to me how initiative works?  I don't get the advantage of
going first if people who have slower reactions than you can just interfere
with what you're doing.

	Excellent question.  There are a number of ways to do this.  The
	standard White Wolf method forces the person with the _worst_
	initiative roll to declare his action first, and people with better
	initiative scores can interrupt.  So, the person with the highest
	initiative actually declares last.  Does this make sense?  No, not
	really, but it maintains a reward for actually rolling well on your
	Wits + Alertness.
	
	You could also just shrug and say, "High initiative goes first", which
	makes the most sense, but if the ST isn't strict, can actually penalize
	people who roll well, as you describe.  You can get around this by
	having players write down what they're going to do, rather than
	announcing it.  This is a more realistic approach anyway.
	
	You can use a variant of the system in World of Darkness: Combat, which
	gives little bonuses and penalties to the initiative order for certain
	actions.  For instance, dodging might receive a + 4 bonus, so you can
	dodge the attack of someone who is no more than four successes ahead of
	you in the initiative order.  I like this system a lot, but it's more
	bookkeeping for you.
	
	Alternately, you can combine the first two systems.  Allow the player
	with the highest initiative the option of going first, or saving his
	action until farther down in the initiative order, interrupting as he
	wishes.
	
	Note that the stunt: Last Call, which is a feature of several Powers,
	plays havoc with the initiative system (see below).
	
I have an idea for a new Power.  What do I do about it?

	If you're a Storyteller, then playtest it.  Remember, there may be
	some Powers that you would only allow NPCs to have (like Total Recall,
	for instance), but if you find that the Power would be too unbalancing
	for a player to have, then revise it.  If you're a player, then submit
	it to your ST, or even to me.  I'd be happy to take a look at it, and
	it might even become canon.

When can I buy a new Power?

	Good question.  Most of the time, you can't.  You can improve the
	Ranks of the ones you have.  Sometimes, though, a Power Stunt will
	give you the option of buying a new Power with experience points. 
	There is also the Merit: Hidden Power.  The Storyteller can also allow
	you to do so if he likes, but I caution that the character can get
	quite out of hand if it is easy to acquire new Powers.

There aren't very many Powers that have Stunts listed.  Does this mean
that these Powers don't have any?

	No.  It means that you'll have to think of some.  Your Storyteller
	will have to approve them, of course.

Do you have to make a new roll to maintain the effects of a Power each
round?

	No.  You can usually keep your original roll.  In the case of a high
	concentration Power, you don't have to re-roll unless you are
	distracted or you split your dice pool.  You can't use another high or
	low concentration Power while maintaining a high concentration effect.
	For a low concentration Power, you can keep up your concentration, no
	problem-- but you lose one die from all dice pools that do not relate
	to a Power (such as a Dex + Dodge roll) and your Rank in the maintained
	Power from the dice pools of other low concentration Powers you wish
	to use.  Most no-concentration Powers don't have maintenance effects,
	but if you come across one, treat it as a low concentration Power for
	these purposes.  The exception to this rule is the Power: Split Mind.

Can you use more than one high concentration Power at once?

	Not without the Power: Split Mind.  In fact, you can't use a high
	concentration Power in conjunction even with a low concentration Power
	except as a Power Stunt, or unless you have either Split Mind or 
	Synthetic Merger.

Can you split your dice pool to perform more than one task with a single
high concentration Power?

	Yes, but it's bloody hard.  I recommend the expenditure of a point of
	Willpower every time it is attempted, and an increase in difficulty
	for both actions.  Benevolent STs may allow such multi-tasking to
	be developed as a Power Stunt: one such Stunt for each combination
	that the mutant attempts.  Bastard STs may require the expenditure
	of a point of Power Charge.  This proviso also includes a few active 
	Powers that require no activation concentration, such as Hyper-Evasion.

Can you split your dice pool to perform more than one task with a single
(or multiple) low concentration Power(s)?

	Yep.  It works the same way as splitting your dice pool normally,
	unless you're talking about a maintenance effect.  In that case, see
	above.

Lots of Powers have the Stunt: Last Call, which allows a mutant to declare
his action last.  If two or more people have that Stunt, who actually
declares last?

	The mutant with the highest Rank, or (failing that) the mutant with the
	highest Perception, Intelligence, Wits, or Alertness, in that order. 
	If they're identical down to the beam, the ST picks the player with the
	nicest hair.  No, I'm not kidding.  Note also that X-Factoring trumps
	them all; a character with X-Factoring always declares last.
