# Path of Levinbolt

Lightning has long been considered the dominion of the gods, but has traditionally been out of reach of thaumaturges due to a lack of understanding of the principles of electricity. As a result, this Path remained relatively obscure until the birth of modern science. The ample supply of electricity in the late 19th century meant that thaumaturges no longer had to wait until a convenient storm to charge their powers, but could
gather the required electricity in mere seconds to direct as they chose. Practitioners of the Path of the Levinbolt tend to cause a good deal of static electricity around them, even when not engaging their powers. Sometimes this plays havoc with cellular service, causes lights to flicker without reason, and computers to experience power surges in their presence. A number of the powers in this Path are activated by touch. Depending upon the circumstances, the Storyteller may require a successful **Dexterity + Brawl** roll for the thaumaturge to make contact with the intended victim. Targeting rules (see V20, p. 274) apply for attacking a specific extremity if contact is guaranteed.


## â€¢ Flicker
Novice thaumaturges learn to freely absorb power
around them through electrical outlets, circuits, or
batteries. A user of this power can sense the current
feeding into a specific electrical system and then draw
it to her, effectively turning it off.
System: The thaumaturge simply glances at a target
powered by electricity. Upon a successful activation
roll, she can shut down an electrical device for ten
minutes per success on the activation roll. The spark
of electricity arcs from the device directly into the
thaumaturge in a frightening display of mystical power.
The source of this power is immediately known.
