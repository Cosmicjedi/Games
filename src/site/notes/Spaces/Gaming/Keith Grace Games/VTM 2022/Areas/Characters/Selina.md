Whether her name was Selina in life is unknown. 
Date of embrace suspected after the year 1250.

She has the reputational merits Distinguished Lineage, and Notoriety. 
She has Status 3, stated as Knowledgeable, Influential, and Well Known. 
As a result of her Notoriety, she is often treated as only having Status 1 
by members of the city with equal or higher status.

The reasons for her Notoriety involve fraternization with the infamous 
Setite Keminitri before Keminitri  was placed on the Camarilla Red List.
