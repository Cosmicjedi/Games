# Eyes of the Abyss




With this ritual, the Abyss Mystic summons tiny
denizens of the Abyss to act as her servants, most often
being used as spies.
System: The vampire crushes a small flame(e.g. a
lit candle) in her bare hand, taking a level of aggravated
damage. She then makes a Rötschreck check, difficulty 4.
If she succeeds, roll Intelligence + Occult, difficulty 6. A
botch results in an additional level of aggravated damage.
On a success, a tiny Abyss elemental is summoned and
consumes the extinguished flame.
The creature remains a number of nights equal to
the successes rolled. The elemental will respond to and
obey all commands given by the caster. It cannot affect
the material world, though it can communicate mentally
by entering a person’s shadow. Any non-Mystic who
communicates with an Abyss elemental in such a fashion
must make a Courage check, difficulty 6. Failure results
in a temporary Derangement that lasts the remainder of
the evening. On a botch, the Derangement is permanent
and can only be cured through repeated use of Willpower.
The elemental is always in shadow form (as Tenebrous
Avatar, see p. 230), can fly 30 yards/meters per turn, and
is instantly destroyed by fire or sunlight. A level 2 version
of this ritual, Talons of the Abyss, can summon shadow
elementals that are corporeal and can even attack enemies.


## TALON OF THE ABYSS
The Abyss Elemental looks the part of an 
amorphous blob of inky shadow. It can temporarily
take whatever shape it’d like, up to the size
of a human child.
