# Road of Honorable Night


## Lexicon:

This path las a lexicon that needs to be explained to understand it correctly: 

**Humane** - beings either on humanity or a path that espouses the humane existence. beings on inhumane paths such as path of night, mortals who do not track humanity are considered humane so long as they do not have a derangement or nature that makes them inhumane example Hannibal lector would not be humane even though he is a mortal. Demons are considered Humane as long as there Torment doesn't exceed 5 and they do not possess a nature which is in itself inhumane with the exception of Ravagers who are all inhumane. werewolves are judged by there wyrm taint, and there nature. 

**Living Being** - this one is rather simple if it is undead example vampire, wraith, risen. it is not a living being. Mummies are living beings.

**Lying** - this is not as simple as "a false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth."  any untruth intentionally given to an ally or neutral party is a Lie. however deception of an enemy intended to keep ones plans a secret is not. example Deception to an enemy in combat or to hide ones intention of combat is not seen as a lie. however telling an enemy the sky is orange when it is blue is. 

## Tenants 
Embracing the inherent honor of the Viking people is at the core of this path of morality. therefore most of its beliefs are summed up in 8 of the 9 precepts of Viking morality. the ninth was omitted because it doesn't foster good group dynamic. 


**Courage**
Showing fear is unacceptable because being afraid means you have already lost the encounter.

**Truth**
Lies are poison to your soul and those who hear it. deceiving an enemy of your intentions is not a lie.

**Honor**
your actions are judged by your ancestors, and those around you, being honorable means to be true to what they believed in.

**Fidelity**
being faithful to persons to which you have made a promise, to causes you have promised support, and most importantly to your beliefs, he must be unequivocally loyal to those that were close to them.

**Discipline**
follow your beliefs even when it was not convenient.

**Hospitality**
old school style hospitality which requires Obligations of host to Guest and Guest to Host

**Industriousness**
if something was worth doing then it was worth doing well.

**Perseverance**
Giving up is not an option

## Virtues: 
**Conviction** and **Self Control**

## Bearing:
**Hospitality**: to keep their offer of hospitality is paramount, and are very difficult to sway from their duty to it. The bearing modifier affects rolls to resist attempts to manipulate or force them to go against their offered hospitality.

| 10     | Failing to uphold all the precepts of hospitality | without hospitality we are but monsters which can not be trusted                                                                                              |
| 9      | Killing humane beings for any reason                            | killing ends the chance of an honorable life, beings who are not humane can not understand honor and therefore are lost already.                                                                                                                   |
| 8      | Associating with the dishonorable                 | one is judged by the company they keep.                                                                                                                       |
| 7      | Disobeying your leader                            | Loyalty is a keystone of Discipline and Honor                                                                                                                 |
| 6      | Killing living beings for any reason other than survival        | to kill in battle is one thing, to kill in pleasure is monstrous. sending a kindred to final death isn't killing they died long ago at the hands of another.                                                                                               |

| 4      | failing to give your best effort                  | failing is okay, failing because you didn't try your best is not.                                                                                             |
| 3      | Surrendering is not an option                     | in combat or in life giving up is a failure of Perseverance this doesn't mean you may never retreat you just can not give up on the fight or underlying cause |
