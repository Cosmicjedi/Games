# Talons of Black Rage
Originally, the Talons of the Black Rage was a secret organization of ghouls trained by the Lasombra Clan to carry out daytime raids on strategic targets. They are thought to date back to the nineteenth century, and began as a small group of mercenaries and soldiers who had been taken under the Clan’s wing. Over time, the ghouls were trained to operate in peak, physical condition and master certain Disciplines, such as Obtenebration and Potence, that would give them an edge in combat. They are also taught how to guard themselves against vampiric
manipulation, which prevents the Talons from being unduly used by the Clan’s enemies. 

To high-ranking officials within the Sabbat, the Talons of the Black Rage is the Sect’s advanced expeditionary unit that is sent out prior to the attack on a Camarilla-held city or territory. 

To the Camarilla’s Justicars, however, the Talons are an elite paramilitary force that is capable of hunting vampires. In fact, many of the Talons have either been selected from the military or have experience in urban warfare. Most vampires are not aware that the Talons of the Black Rage exist, and those who do are under the mistaken impression that there are only thirteen members, seven men and six women, in total. That, however, is the number of members for each unit. Though the Talons of the Black Rage are often commanded by high-ranking members of the Lasombra Clan when their mission is to attack the Camarilla, in recent years the Talons have also been tasked with gathering information about the growing influence of the revenant families, including those serving the Tzimisce. To this end, the Talons have been secretly monitoring and tracking down as many family members as they can, with the help of the Lasombra, but the task is time-intensive. Some of the Talons feel the best way to learn more about revenant families would be to kidnap members to interrogate them. However, others within the group believe the timing isn’t right, because they don’t want to start a war just yet. Most of the Talons train hard and are expected to live short, brutal lives, but they are not suicidal. They believe they have been chosen for a higher purpose, to bring terror and death to the Lasombra’s adversaries. All too often, these ghouls are sent after Sheriffs, Primogen, and other high-ranking Kindred whose death would weaken an enemy-held city’s power structure for the upcoming invasion.
