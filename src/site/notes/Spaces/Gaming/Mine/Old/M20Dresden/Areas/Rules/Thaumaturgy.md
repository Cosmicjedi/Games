# Thaumaturgy 

1) rotes are not needed and can be fast cast. 
2) Foci do not effect thaumaturgy but most thaumaturgy requires props to make links.
3) To form a Thaumaturgy link to a target you must have either 
	1) a piece of the target
	2) Their blood
	3) Their NAME. in the case of mortals names are viable longer than blood but do change over time as ones understanding of self changes (per Dresden files Grave Peril) Names of creatures of the nevernever seldom change as those beings know who they are. 
4) Thaumaturgy is best done inside a closed [[Spaces/Gaming/Mine/Old/M20Dresden/Areas/Rules/Circle|Circle]]. 
5) all Thaumaturgy requires I quintessence to cast minimum. the first is spent from your personal reserve. the rest can be drawn from around you. you require 1 quintessence per success rolled or 1 per success required whichever is higher to generate the effect. when not using a [[Spaces/Gaming/Mine/Old/M20Dresden/Areas/Rules/Circle|Circle]].
6) when using a circle you need only use enough quintessence to generate the effect. 
7) you do not need to garner all successes in a single round.
8) required successes are determined before the roll is made to generate the effect and is shared with the player. the character may then cast the spell with or without a [[Spaces/Gaming/Mine/Old/M20Dresden/Areas/Rules/Circle|Circle]]. players choice.
9) Channeled quintessence from the air still counts towards your maximum spent in a round. 
10) see avatar for what happens if you spend more than your avatar in quintessence per round.
11) Thaumaturgy is cast with Manipulation + Arete
